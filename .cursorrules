# Project Preferences

## Code Style
- No JSDoc comments
- No inline comments unless explaining non-obvious logic
- Code should be self-documenting through clear naming
- Prefer clear variable and function names over comments

## Documentation
- Use README.md files for usage examples and documentation
- Keep code clean and readable without verbose comments
- AI assistants can read code directly, so extensive comments are unnecessary
