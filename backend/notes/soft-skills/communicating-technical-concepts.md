# Communicating Technical Concepts

## Teaching Through Metaphor and Experience

I'm good at explaining complex technical concepts by relating them to familiar experiences. My background in art, teaching kayaking, and bridging teams at Nurtur has developed this skill.

## Core Teaching Philosophy

**Make people want to learn by aligning the subject with their goals and values**: When teaching CSS to backend developers transitioning to frontend, I don't just explain syntax. I show them how CSS solves their specific problems and helps them contribute to their team.

**Make people feel it's okay to not know**: The biggest barrier to learning is feeling like you'll never understand it. I let people know we all felt like them at the start. This psychological safety allows actual learning to happen.

**Teach basic principles and work up**: Rather than overwhelming with everything at once, I show fundamentals and how to frame problems. Once someone understands the foundation, they can build their own knowledge.

## Practical Examples

### Dashboard Project: Backend Team ↔ Sales Team

The backend developers and sales team struggled to communicate because they had completely different perspectives. The sales team spent all day talking to customers and working with spreadsheets. The backend team worked with Azure functions and C# code. They thought in different terms even about the same subject.

**My approach**: I could talk to both teams because of my coding background combined with more social pursuits like art, kayaking, and teaching. I explained backend constraints to the sales team in terms of their workflow and customer needs. I translated sales requests to the backend team in terms of data structures and API requirements.

### Teaching CSS to Backend Developers

CSS is often confusing for backend developers, and there's pressure to contribute quickly and not feel like dead weight. **I make them feel comfortable by**:
- Showing that CSS has logical patterns, just different from backend logic
- Relating concepts to things they know (layout is like data structures, cascading is like inheritance)
- Framing problems in ways that match how they already think
- Letting them know the confusion is normal and temporary

## Metaphors and Analogies

From my profile examples, I relate technical concepts to familiar things:
- Comparing code organization to physical objects people understand
- Using visual metaphors from art to explain abstract technical patterns
- Drawing parallels between technical systems and natural systems

## Communication with Non-Technical Stakeholders

The Integrations Dashboard required collaborating with the sales team who weren't technical. **My strategy**:
- Focus on what they need to accomplish, not how the code works
- Show them the interface and workflow, get feedback on usability
- Explain technical constraints in terms of business impact
- Ask questions about their process before suggesting technical solutions

## Active Listening

I approach communication by listening first. In teaching, pair programming, or cross-team collaboration, I make sure I understand someone's actual problem before offering solutions. Often what people think they need isn't what they actually need, and listening reveals the real issue.
