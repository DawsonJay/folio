# Work-Life Balance Approach

## Connection to the World as Fuel

My approach to work-life balance is rooted in my core values of wonder and connection. I maintain balance not just by having hobbies, but by nurturing my connection to the world in ways that sustain and energize me.

## Nature and Outdoor Activities

**Connection to the world is as fulfilling and sustainable as connection to people** - it's not a second-best option when social energy runs out.

**Kayaking**: I'm a multiple gold medalist in kayaking slalom and was an instructor. Kayaking connects me to rivers, seasons, and the physical challenge of navigating dynamic systems. This experience taught me discipline, pressure management, and the value of consistent effort.

**Hiking**: If I need to go hiking for 2 days with a notebook to think through a problem, that's how I work best. Nature provides space for deep thinking and creative problem-solving away from screens.

**Gardening and ecology**: Treating the Earth with the same love, empathy, and respect as I do people I love. Nurturing life and feeling connected to earth's cycles provides grounding and perspective.

**Experiencing awe**: Stars, land, seasons - feeling part of the cosmos. This wonder reminds me why I'm drawn to exploration technology and gives me energy to pursue ambitious goals.

## Creative Pursuits

My background in fine art and photography isn't abandoned - it's integrated. I still appreciate and create beautiful things, whether that's elegant code architecture, thoughtful UI design, or actual artwork.

**The creative flow state** I experienced in art (working relentlessly until early morning, getting one thing perfect) transfers directly to coding. The difference is that coding also exercises my intellectual side in ways that art alone didn't.

## Time and Space for Thinking

I'm self-directed and work best when I can structure my own time. Sometimes that means:
- Deep focus sessions where I code for hours
- Walks or hikes where I think through problems away from my desk
- Time in nature to reset and gain perspective
- Flexible schedules that match my energy rhythms

## Sustainable Work Philosophy

**"Work that matters, not the process"**: I want to be judged on results, not on sitting at a desk for specific hours. This philosophy naturally creates balance because it respects that good work comes from a healthy, energized person, not from grinding endlessly.

**Purpose over money**: "I don't want to work for money alone." When work is meaningful and aligned with my values, it's energizing rather than draining. This doesn't mean working endless hours - it means the hours I work feel worthwhile.

## Social Connection

While I'm comfortable working independently, I learned from freelancing that isolation isn't healthy for me. **Balance means having a small, motivated team** where I can:
- Share clever solutions with people who understand them
- Collaborate on difficult challenges
- Feel part of something meaningful together

## Long-term Sustainability

My career should reflect my work coming more and more in line with my values. This alignment is what makes work sustainable long-term. If I'm building something I believe in, with people I respect, while maintaining my connection to nature and creative expression, that's balance.

The goal isn't to compartmentalize "work" and "life" - it's to integrate them in a way where each enriches the other. My outdoor experiences teach me about resilience and systems thinking. My technical work satisfies my intellectual curiosity and creativity. My connections to people and nature keep me grounded and motivated.
