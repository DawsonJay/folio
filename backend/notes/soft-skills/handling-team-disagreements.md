# Handling Team Disagreements

## My Approach: Empathy and Consensus

My leadership style focuses on creating safe spaces where people can discover their own strength, not controlling them. This philosophy guides how I handle disagreements.

## Core Principles

**Respect autonomy**: People have their own perspectives and choices. My role isn't to force my view but to help the team find the best solution together.

**Listen to understand**: Before presenting my perspective, I focus on truly understanding what others think and why. Often disagreements come from different valid concerns that all need addressing.

**Put aside ego**: What matters is the project and creating something valuable, not being right. I try to approach disagreements with professional respect and focus on goals rather than personal positions.

**Make decisions by consensus**: In my ideal team structure, everyone has a stake in the project's success. Decisions should emerge from collaborative discussion where everyone feels heard.

## Practical Example: Dashboard Development

When building the Integrations Dashboard, there were natural tensions between what the backend team thought was needed and what the sales team actually wanted. The backend developers had been building in isolation, making changes they thought best without checking with users first.

**I bridged this gap by**:
- Talking at length with both teams to understand their different perspectives
- Recognizing that the communication breakdown came from siloing and different worldviews (sales team thought in terms of customers, backend team in terms of code and fields)
- Creating space for both teams to explain their needs without judgment
- Finding solutions that respected the backend's technical constraints while serving the sales team's actual workflow

## When Disagreements Get Personal

I've learned from teaching kayaking and CSS to backend developers that most conflicts come from feeling inadequate or misunderstood, not actual technical differences.

**My approach**:
- Make people feel it's okay to not know something right now
- Focus on the problem we're solving together, not who's right
- Share my own early struggles so people don't feel alone in their confusion
- Acknowledge when someone has a valid concern, even if we can't address it immediately

## Knowing When to Stand Firm

I'm willing to disagree constructively when values are at stake. When offered an interview for freemium games, I politely ended it because I disagreed with the ethics. I was polite and clear, but I stood by my principles.

In team settings, if a disagreement touches on ethics, user harm, or fundamental project values, I'll advocate strongly while remaining respectful. But for most technical decisions, I trust the consensus process and my teammates' expertise.
