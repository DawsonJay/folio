# Receiving and Acting on Feedback

I value feedback as essential to creating valuable work and improving as a developer.

## Feedback Philosophy

My approach to feedback comes from two sources: teaching kayaking and building the Integrations Dashboard at Nurtur.

**Feedback is about the work, not about me**: I separate my ego from my code. What matters is creating something that solves problems and provides value, not being right about how I initially approached it.

**Real feedback makes real value**: When building the Integrations Dashboard, I talked at length with both the sales team and backend team to find out what they needed and what they found most valuable as I worked. This real feedback and collaboration was vital to making something that provided real value. The result has been in production for 3+ years with zero maintenance, proving that feedback-driven development creates lasting solutions.

## How I Seek Feedback

**Early and often**: I don't wait until something is "done" to ask for feedback. I check in with stakeholders throughout development to make sure I'm on the right track.

**From multiple perspectives**: On the dashboard project, I sought feedback from both technical (backend team) and non-technical (sales team) stakeholders. Different perspectives reveal different problems and opportunities.

**Specific questions**: Instead of "what do you think?", I ask targeted questions like "does this workflow match how you actually use the system?" or "is this the information you need to make decisions?"

## Acting on Feedback

**Listen first**: As a kayaking instructor and when teaching CSS to backend developers, I learned to listen to what people actually need before explaining my perspective. This skill transfers to receiving technical feedback.

**Evaluate thoughtfully**: Not all feedback is equal. I consider the source's expertise, the problem they're trying to solve, and whether their suggestion aligns with the project's goals.

**Communicate changes**: When I act on feedback, I explain what I changed and why. When I don't, I explain my reasoning respectfully.

The feedback loop is how I learn and improve. My best work comes from collaboration, not isolation.
