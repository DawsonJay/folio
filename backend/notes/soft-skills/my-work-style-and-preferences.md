# My Work Style and Preferences

## Core Philosophy: "Work That Matters, Not the Process"

I prefer to be judged on what I create, not how I create it. If I need to go hiking for 2 days with a notebook and that's how I work best, that's totally fine as long as my work gets done.

## Self-Directed and Goal-Driven

**I'm always pursuing goals**: Learning happens naturally when working toward meaningful objectives. I taught myself Python to work with Arduinos, C# to make Unity games, and Java before university. Each skill emerged from a goal that inspired me.

**Results over rigid schedules**: I work best without specific hours or schedules. Meet twice a week, assign tasks, and expect them done when we next meet. I enjoy personal responsibility and the freedom to structure my own time.

**Deep focus when needed**: I can spend hours in a creative flow state, staying up until early morning to get one thing perfect. This intensity comes from my art background, where I'd work relentlessly until something felt exactly right.

## Intuition and Logic Combined

My artistic background gives me valuable intuition about code structure and project health. This intuition acts as a compass, helping me sense when I'm on the wrong path or when something is "done" and further work would be perfectionism rather than practical improvement.

**I follow intuition with rigorous logical investigation**: The feeling guides where to look; evidence proves what's actually wrong.

## Collaborative but Independent

I like small groups (3-4 people) who are all very motivated and believe in the project. Everyone should be extremely good at what they do and have a stake in success.

**I don't enjoy working alone**: Freelancing taught me this. While I'm comfortable with self-direction, I'm more motivated when I can share clever solutions with someone who understands them. Being able to share difficult parts with teammates makes challenges much easier.

**I'm comfortable leading when appropriate**: I often take responsibility for organizing others and getting work in on time, but I don't chafe against following either. Leadership should be about support, not control.

## Communication Style

I prefer consensus-based decisions where everyone puts aside ego because what we care about is the project. Professional respect and passion matter more than hierarchy.

My approach to collaboration comes from my "team dad" leadership style: bringing people together, encouraging everyone to be their best, and creating safe spaces where people can discover their own strength.
