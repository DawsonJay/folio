# My Ideal Work Environment

## Team Structure

**Small team of 3-4 people who are all very motivated**: Large teams don't work together well in my experience. Small teams can truly collaborate and move quickly.

**Everyone believes in the project and is extremely good at what they do**: Passion and skill create momentum. When everyone cares deeply and contributes excellence, the team becomes greater than the sum of its parts.

**Everyone has a stake in the project**: If it succeeds, we all benefit. This shared investment means everyone's committed to quality and success, not just collecting a paycheck.

**Professional respect and passion**: Teams should be driven by respect for each other's expertise and passion for what we're building, not by hierarchy or ego.

## Work Culture

**Puts aside ego because what we care about is the project**: Decisions should be about what's best for the work, not who's right. Consensus-based decision-making where everyone feels heard.

**One person takes responsibility for organizing**: Often that's me. Someone needs to coordinate everyone else and ensure work gets done on time, but this is support leadership, not authoritarian control.

**Focus on results, not process**: "The work that matters, not the process." I want to be judged on what I create, not monitored on how I create it.

## Flexibility and Trust

**No specific hours or schedules**: Meet twice a week in person, assign tasks, and expect them to be done when we next meet. If I need to go hiking for 2 days with a notebook because that's how I work best, that's totally fine as long as my work gets done.

**Personal responsibility**: I enjoy being trusted to manage my own time and deliver quality work. This requires teammates who also take ownership.

**Deep focus when needed**: Sometimes I need to work in creative flow for hours, staying up until early morning to get something perfect. An ideal environment respects that different people have different rhythms.

## What I Don't Want

**Isolation**: Freelancing taught me I don't want to work alone. Being able to share clever solutions with someone who understands them motivates me. Being able to share difficult parts with teammates makes challenges much easier.

**Customer relations as primary focus**: I didn't enjoy freelance work because it became mostly about customer relations rather than building excellent software. I want to focus on technical excellence and creating value, not managing client expectations.

**Meaningless work**: I don't want to work for money alone. Whether it's a real estate agent site, an online meat shop, or a dashboard for internal tools, the work needs to matter to someone and solve real problems.

## Values Alignment

**Meaningful work that aligns with my values**: I care about wonder and connection, about helping people experience and share beauty in the world. Ideally my work contributes to this, whether through exploration technology (deep sea/space), environmental solutions, or tools that genuinely help people.

**Ethical work**: I walked away from a freemium games interview because I disagreed with the ethics. I need to believe in what I'm building.

## Long-term Vision

My ideal is working on a project like deep sea or space exploration - something that encourages interest, excitement, and love for the world, builds empathy with nature, and shares wonder and discovery. But I'm sure there are many projects that align with my values that I would approach with the same passion.
