# Helping Struggling Teammates

## Leadership Through Support

My "team dad" leadership style is about encouraging everyone to be their best and creating safe spaces where people can discover their own strength and courage. I don't lead through control; I lead through support.

## Creating Psychological Safety

The biggest barrier to learning and growth is feeling like you'll never understand or that you're letting the team down. **My first priority is making people feel safe**.

### Example: Lauren in the Abandoned Building

At university, I was in a photography project group exploring an abandoned building. Lauren was very nervous. I was always there to encourage her - not to make her do anything, but to be there to catch her if she fell.

**What I said to her**: "It is brave to do something when you're afraid, and you are the bravest out of all of us because you're the most out of your comfort zone."

This reframing helped her see her fear not as weakness but as courage. We saw amazing sights together, including a room where sunlight pierced through a collapsed ceiling, creating an oasis of light where a tree grew right out of the concrete and rust.

### Example: Teaching CSS to Backend Developers

Backend developers transitioning to frontend often feel tremendous pressure. CSS is confusing and they worry about being dead weight to the team.

**My approach**:
- Make them feel it's okay to not know how right now
- Show the fundamentals and how to frame CSS problems
- Share that the biggest problem in learning is feeling like you'll never get it
- Let them know we all felt like them at the start

## Mentoring at Nurtur

In the Email Editor project, I mentored backend developers who were learning frontend work. This involved:
- **Pair programming sessions** where I could show my process and thinking
- **Code reviews** that teach rather than criticize
- **Patient instruction** that builds up skills incrementally
- **Encouragement** that builds confidence alongside competence

## My Mentoring Philosophy

**I don't just teach skills; I teach confidence**: Technical skills without confidence means people won't take initiative or trust their judgment. I want teammates who know they can figure things out.

**Small continuous improvements**: Rather than overwhelming with everything at once, I focus on helping people make small improvements consistently. Over time, these add up to real mastery.

**I'm there to catch them if they fall**: Like with Lauren, I let people know I'm there as support. They can try difficult things because they know they're not alone if it goes wrong.

**Celebrate their perspective**: Everyone brings something valuable. Backend developers learning frontend might see patterns frontend specialists miss. I help people recognize what they bring rather than only focusing on what they lack.

## When Someone is Truly Struggling

If a teammate is genuinely struggling (not just learning):
- **Talk privately first**: Understand what's really happening. Is it technical skills, unclear requirements, personal issues, or team dynamics?
- **Focus on the work that matters**: Help them prioritize what actually needs to be excellent vs. what's perfectionism
- **Share the load**: Collaborate on the difficult parts while they handle aspects where they're confident
- **Check in regularly**: Not to micromanage, but to show I care and they're not alone

My goal is always to help people discover they're more capable than they thought. That's what real leadership does.
