# Handling Stress and Pressure

I've developed strong stress management skills through kayaking slalom competition and high-pressure technical work.

## Competition Experience

As a kayaking slalom competitor, I learned to handle tremendous pressure. In competitions, you paddle down a river through gates as fast as possible. Missing a gate adds to your time, and it's easy to get upset and miss more gates. I learned to move on from mistakes quickly and stay focused under pressure.

Training required getting up on frozen mornings to paddle on icy rivers because missing a day was unacceptable to my goals. I competed while juggling university coursework, teaching me to manage time, resources, and stress simultaneously.

## Pressure Management Strategies

**Move on from mistakes quickly**: In both kayaking and debugging, dwelling on errors wastes time. I acknowledge the mistake, learn from it, and refocus on the solution.

**The real work is done when no one is watching**: I learned that success comes from consistent effort in low-pressure moments, not just performance when it matters. This means staying calm under deadline pressure because I know the foundational work is solid.

**Failure is giving up, not making mistakes**: I didn't win every kayaking competition, but losses didn't hold me back. This mindset helps me stay resilient when projects face setbacks or technical challenges don't resolve quickly.

## Work Application

In technical work, I handle stress by:
- **Trusting my intuition**: Years of experience give me gut feelings about what's wrong, reducing panic when debugging complex issues
- **Breaking problems down**: Frame the limits first, then find creative solutions within those constraints
- **Maintaining perspective**: Remembering that I'm solving interesting problems with skilled teammates, not fighting fires alone
- **Taking breaks when needed**: If I need to go hiking for 2 days with a notebook to think through a problem, that's how I work best

I stay calm under pressure because I know consistent preparation and strong fundamentals mean I can handle whatever comes up.
