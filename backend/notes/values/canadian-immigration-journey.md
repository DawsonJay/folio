# Canadian Immigration Journey and Motivation

I'm pursuing immigration to Canada through the Working Holiday visa program, with plans to apply in 2026 when I'm eligible. This isn't a casual decision or just about getting a visa - it's a carefully considered step toward building a life in a place that aligns with my values and career goals.

My motivation for Canada is something I describe as "homesickness for a place I've never been." There's something about Canada - its environmental values, its approach to technology and innovation, its balance between wild spaces and cities, its culture around exploration and conservation - that resonates deeply with me. I've never been there, but everything I learn about it makes me feel like it's where I should be.

The Working Holiday visa strategy is deliberate. It gives me a two-year window to prove myself in the Canadian job market and demonstrate that I'm someone worth keeping. I'm not looking for shortcuts or trying to game the system - I'm building a portfolio of real work that shows Canadian employers what I can contribute. This Folio project, my other portfolio pieces, and the professional experience I'm gaining at Nurtur are all part of showing that I'm serious and capable.

I've completed my WES (World Education Services) educational credential assessment for Canadian immigration purposes. I've taken the IELTS English proficiency exam and scored 8.5 overall (C2 level), with perfect scores in listening, reading, and speaking. These aren't just bureaucratic checkboxes - they're demonstrations of my commitment and preparation.

What attracts me to Canadian tech culture specifically is the focus on environmental technology and exploration projects. Canada has companies working on ocean mapping, climate technology, space industry connections, and sustainable systems - exactly the kinds of values-aligned projects I want to contribute to. The Canadian tech sector seems to value building things that matter, not just chasing venture capital and unicorn exits.

My 10-year vision involves working on deep sea or space exploration projects, or environmental technology that helps restore humanity's relationship with the natural world. Canada has the culture, the companies, and the opportunities that align with these goals in ways that the UK tech scene doesn't. Canadian values around wilderness, conservation, exploration, and practical innovation feel like a natural fit for my Wonder and Connection framework.

I'm realistic about the challenges. Immigration is difficult and uncertain. The Working Holiday visa is competitive. I'll be moving to a new country where I don't have an existing network. But I'm approaching this the same way I approach complex technical projects - by understanding the constraints, planning carefully, building the skills and portfolio I need, and being persistent in working toward the goal.

This portfolio of work I'm building isn't just about getting hired - it's about showing who I am and what I care about. The projects I choose, the way I approach problems, the values that guide my decisions - all of this demonstrates that I'm someone who would fit naturally into teams working on meaningful problems. I want Canadian employers to see not just my technical capabilities but my genuine alignment with the kinds of work they're doing.

I'm not looking to move to Canada and then figure out what to do. I'm building specific skills in AI/ML, RAG systems, full-stack development, and hardware integration because these are the capabilities that Canadian companies need for the kinds of projects I want to work on. When I apply for positions, I want to be someone who can contribute immediately to meaningful work.

The immigration journey is long, but it's worth it for the chance to build a career around projects that truly matter. Canada represents the opportunity to align my professional work with my personal values in ways that haven't been available in my current context. That alignment - doing work that matters in a place that values the same things I do - is worth the effort and uncertainty of immigration.
