# Project Links: GitHub Repositories and Live Demos

Here's a comprehensive list of my projects with links to live demonstrations and source code repositories. These projects span AI/ML systems, full-stack web applications, hardware integration, and enterprise software, demonstrating the breadth of my technical capabilities.

## WhatNow - AI Activity Recommendation System

**Live Application:** https://whatnow-frontend.onrender.com

**Source Code:**
- Frontend Repository: https://github.com/DawsonJay/whatnow-frontend
- Backend Repository: https://github.com/DawsonJay/whatnow-backend

The live application lets you try the contextual bandit recommendation system that learns from your choices. Select context tags like mood and energy level, get AI-generated activity suggestions, and watch the system refine recommendations based on your preferences. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, while the backend uses FastAPI with PostgreSQL, implementing the two-layer learning architecture with Session AI and Base AI.

## moh-ami - French Learning Translation Tool

**Live Application:** https://moh-ami-production.up.railway.app/

**Source Code:** https://github.com/DawsonJay/moh-ami

The live application demonstrates LLM integration for educational purposes. Enter English text and receive French translations with word-by-word mappings, grammar explanations, cultural context, and alternative translations. Built with Next.js 14, GraphQL, Prisma, and OpenAI GPT-4o-mini. The synchronized scrolling and interactive chunk highlighting showcase advanced UI patterns.

## Cirrus - Wildfire Prediction System (Cancelled Project)

**Source Code:** https://github.com/DawsonJay/cirrus-project

This repository contains the complete data engineering pipeline, spatial interpolation algorithms, genetic algorithm evolution framework, and database optimization code for the Cirrus weather prediction system. While I cancelled the project due to fundamental data quality issues, the technical implementation demonstrates sophisticated spatial data processing, KD-tree indexing for efficient nearest-neighbor queries, vectorized NumPy operations for performance, and evolutionary AI optimization with crossover and mutation operators. The code shows production-quality data engineering even though the project couldn't achieve its goals due to inadequate source data.

## Atlantis - Underwater Robotics Project

**Source Code:** https://github.com/DawsonJay/atlantis-project

The repository includes Python sensor integration code, hardware documentation, development logs, and technical specifications for the underwater drone project. Contains sensor testing scripts, UART communication protocols for Raspberry Pi coordination, component wiring diagrams, and comprehensive troubleshooting documentation. This demonstrates embedded systems development, hardware-software integration, and engineering methodology for physical computing projects.

## Portfolio Website - This Site

**Live Demo:** You're viewing it right now

**Source Code:** https://github.com/DawsonJay/portfolio-website

This website itself is a portfolio project featuring a theatrical diorama design system with layered SVG animations, React and TypeScript architecture, styled-components theme system, article reader with reusable block components, and responsive two-panel layouts. The repository includes all components, utilities, theme configuration, and documentation of the iterative development process across 40+ documented sessions.

## Folio - RAG-Powered Portfolio Chatbot (Current Project)

**Status:** In active development

**Source Code:** Will be published when complete

This is my current project - an AI-powered portfolio chatbot using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The system combines LangChain for orchestration, Pinecone for vector storage, OpenAI embeddings for semantic search, and GPT-4o-mini for response generation. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript using event-driven architecture, while the backend uses FastAPI with atomic notes stored as embeddings. This represents the cutting edge of my AI/ML and full-stack development capabilities.

## Professional Work at Nurtur

My professional work at Nurtur includes:

- **Integrations Dashboard:** Internal production system (proprietary code, cannot share) running for 2+ years with zero maintenance, used daily by 15+ team members
- **Nexus Dashboard:** Enterprise component system with foundation block architecture for Job Manager visualization (proprietary)
- **Email Editor Contributions:** Lexical framework integration and drag-and-drop system improvements (proprietary)

While I cannot share the source code for proprietary work, I can discuss the architecture, technical decisions, and outcomes in interviews.

## GitHub Profile

**Main GitHub:** https://github.com/DawsonJay

My GitHub profile contains these repositories plus various experiments, smaller projects, and contributions. The commit history across projects shows consistent development activity, clear commit messages, and evolution of code quality over time.

## How to Evaluate These Projects

When reviewing these projects, consider:

- **WhatNow and moh-ami** demonstrate production-deployed systems with live demos you can interact with
- **Cirrus** shows technical depth even in a failed project, with sophisticated data engineering and algorithm implementation
- **Atlantis** demonstrates hardware integration and embedded systems development
- **Portfolio Website** shows frontend expertise and design system thinking
- **Folio** represents current work with cutting-edge AI/ML techniques

The combination of live applications, open source code, and documented development decisions provides comprehensive evidence of my technical capabilities, project completion ability, and engineering maturity.
