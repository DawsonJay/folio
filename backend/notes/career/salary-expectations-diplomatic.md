# Approach to Salary Expectations and Negotiation

I handle salary expectations by researching market rates before any conversation about compensation. I look at factors like the Canadian market specifically, location within Canada, role responsibilities, company size, and typical compensation for someone with my experience level - several years of production experience plus AI and machine learning skills. Research gives me a foundation for professional discussion rather than pulling numbers from thin air.

I typically provide a range rather than a specific number when asked about salary expectations. I frame it as being competitive based on market research for the role and my experience level, while making it clear I'm flexible and consider the full opportunity. A range shows I've done my homework while leaving room for negotiation and acknowledging that different companies have different compensation structures.

I emphasize that I'm looking for a competitive package that reflects the value I bring - my production experience, AI and ML capabilities, full-stack skills, and leadership potential. However, I'm genuinely flexible because I consider multiple factors beyond just base salary. Growth opportunities, team culture, professional development support, benefits, and the work itself all matter to me. A role with great growth potential and excellent team culture might be worth more to me than a higher salary with limited advancement possibilities.

When thinking about compensation, I consider the full package. Base salary is important, but so are benefits, professional development opportunities, growth potential, work-life balance, and whether the work is meaningful. A complete evaluation of an opportunity includes all of these factors, not just the number on the salary line. I want to make sure the compensation is fair and competitive for my skills and experience, but I'm also thinking about long-term career value and whether this role will help me grow professionally.

If an offer comes in below what my research suggests is appropriate, I respond professionally. I acknowledge the offer positively and reference my market research. I ask if there's flexibility on the compensation package, and I'm genuinely open to discussing other aspects that could make it work - perhaps additional benefits, professional development support, clear growth opportunities, or other factors that add real value beyond base salary.

The key throughout is being professional, demonstrating I've done my research, showing flexibility, and focusing on finding the right opportunity rather than just maximizing the number. I want to ensure compensation is fair and competitive for my skills and experience while remaining open to the full value proposition of the role. This approach has served me well - it shows I value myself professionally while being reasonable and focused on finding genuine fit rather than just the highest bidder.
