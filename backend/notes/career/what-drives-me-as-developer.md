# What Drives Me as a Developer

## Core Motivation: Wonder and Connection

My fundamental values are **wonder** (seeing beauty within things) and **connection** (sharing that wonder, experiencing it together). These drive everything I do as a developer.

## Creating Things That Matter

**The moment of stepping back and seeing something perfect**: I love art and coding for the same reason - you spend hours in a creative frenzy working on a project, staying up until early morning trying to get one thing perfect. Then you step back and see this perfect thing that you made, something real and lasting.

**But coding has an advantage over art**: Success isn't determined by public vibes or subjective taste. It's determined by skill and the value the code produces. It's both creative and intellectual, satisfying multiple needs at once.

## Solving Problems Through Cleverness

**"When resources are scarce, you have to turn to cleverness and creativity"**: I'm driven by the challenge of finding elegant solutions within constraints. The WhatNow project showed this - I had to solve the dataset problem through evolution from manual metadata to embeddings because I couldn't just collect millions of user interactions.

**Innovation and practicality can be the same thing**: The best solutions are both clever and simple. The Integrations Dashboard working for 3+ years without maintenance isn't because it's complicated - it's because it's well-thought-out and stable.

## Making Teams Better

**Being valuable to my team**: I'm not driven by solo glory. I want to be a driving force of creativity, passion, and solutions that makes the whole team stronger.

**Sharing clever solutions**: I learned from freelancing that I need teammates to share solutions with. I'm more motivated when I can show someone a clever approach and they understand why it's elegant.

**Helping others discover their strength**: The "team dad" leadership style isn't just natural - it's what motivates me. When I helped Lauren be brave in the abandoned building, when I taught backend developers that they could learn CSS, those moments of helping someone realize they're more capable than they thought drive me as much as solving technical problems.

## Learning and Growth

**I'm always pursuing goals**: Learning happens naturally when working toward meaningful objectives. I don't think you ever really master a skill - you just learn enough to reach your current goals. People who stop learning are the ones who stop making bigger, more exciting goals.

**Self-directed learning**: I taught myself Python to work with Arduinos, C# to make Unity games, Java before university. Each skill emerged from a goal that inspired me. This drive to teach myself whatever I need to achieve ambitious goals is fundamental to who I am.

**Pushing to new heights**: My career progression from web development → AI/ML → embedded systems → exploration technology isn't random. I'm deliberately building toward work that aligns with my values while continuously expanding what I'm capable of.

## Values Alignment

**I don't want to work for money alone**: When I was offered an interview for freemium games, I ended it because I disagreed with the ethics. No matter how much I needed a job, I couldn't support something I didn't believe in.

**Purpose-driven work**: I want to help restore humanity's relationship with the world. Technologies that help people understand the natural world, help them live with it rather than consume it - those are what I want to build.

**My career evolution should reflect my work coming more in line with my values**: Each project should move me toward work that matters deeply to me. The Integrations Dashboard helped a sales team work better - practical value. WhatNow helped people discover new experiences - connection value. Atlantis was about exploring underwater environments - wonder value.

## The Craft Itself

**Intuition and elegance**: My artistic background gave me intuition about when code structure feels right, when something is "done," when I'm on the wrong path. I love that feeling of the code clicking into place, of finding the elegant solution.

**Results over process**: I care about creating something excellent, not about being seen to work in a particular way. If I need to hike for 2 days with a notebook to think through a problem, that's valid because what matters is the work.

**Building things that last**: The Integrations Dashboard still providing value years later, with stable architecture that doesn't need constant maintenance - that's satisfying in a way that quick hacks never are.

## Long-term Drive

**I want to work on a project like deep sea or space exploration**: Something that encourages interest, excitement, and love for the world. That builds empathy with the world. That shares wonder and discovery.

**Making a difference**: "I want people to know my name because we made something extraordinary and helpful and good that's making a difference." Not famous for being famous, but known for contributing to work that matters.

What drives me is the combination: creating elegant solutions to hard problems, helping my team be their best, continuously learning and growing, and moving toward work that helps people experience the wonder of the natural world. When all of those align, I bring creativity, passion, and solutions that last.
