# Availability and Start Date Timeline

I'm being made redundant at Nurtur, and I'm working through the redundancy process which includes a notice period. I'm committed to ensuring a smooth transition, which means thoroughly documenting my work and helping transition my responsibilities to whoever takes over the Nexus project. Professional transitions matter to me - I don't want to leave a team in the lurch.

After receiving a job offer, I'll need to find housing in Canada, which adds some variability to the exact start date. However, I can handle house hunting during my redundancy notice period while I'm completing the transition at Nurtur, so this shouldn't significantly delay when I can start. I'm flexible and can work with a new employer to find a timeline that works for both parties.

I don't have any other commitments that would affect my start date beyond the redundancy notice period and housing arrangements. My focus is entirely on making a smooth transition and starting a new role ready to contribute from day one.

My ideal timeline would be to complete the redundancy transition at Nurtur, secure housing in Canada, and then start the new role. However, I understand that different opportunities may have different timelines and I'm flexible about that. One option that provides additional flexibility is that I can work remotely from the UK during the transition period if needed. This means I could start contributing to a new team while completing my notice period and finalizing relocation arrangements.

For interview availability, I can make time whenever needed. I'm flexible with scheduling and can accommodate different time zones easily. Fortunately, because of the time difference between the UK and Canada, most of my interviews have been in the evening UK time, which works very well for me and doesn't interfere with my current work schedule. I can be available for interviews on short notice.

I'm committed to making this work and will be proactive about finding housing once I have an offer. The practical aspects of relocation won't be barriers - I'll handle them efficiently so I can start contributing to a new team as soon as is reasonable after my notice period.
