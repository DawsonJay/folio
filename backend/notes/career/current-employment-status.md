# Current Employment Status

I am currently unemployed and actively seeking new opportunities. I was made redundant at Nurtur in February 2026 and have completed my notice period. The redundancy process is completely finished - I am no longer employed at Nurtur and I am not currently working anywhere. I am now fully available and ready to start a new role immediately.

**Current Employment Status**: Unemployed. Not currently employed. Actively job searching. Ready to start immediately.

**Previous Employment**: I worked at Nurtur for 3.5 years (July 2022 - February 2026) until I was made redundant. That role has ended completely.

**Availability**: I can start a new position immediately. I have no notice period, no current employment, and no other commitments that would delay my start date. I am ready to begin work right away.

**Flexibility**: I'm flexible about start dates and can work with employers to find a timeline that works for both parties. I can also work remotely from the UK during the transition period if needed while finalizing relocation arrangements to Canada.

**Interview Availability**: I'm available for interviews at any time. I can accommodate different time zones easily, and I'm flexible with scheduling. I can be available for interviews on short notice.

**Readiness**: I'm ready to contribute from day one. I have 3.5 years of production experience at Nurtur, and I'm eager to bring my skills to a new team and start making an impact immediately.

**When asked "What is your current employment status?" or "Are you currently employed?" or "Where do you work?"**: I am currently unemployed. I was made redundant at Nurtur in February 2026 and I am now actively seeking new opportunities. I am ready to start immediately.
