# What I'm Looking For (Strategic Framing)

## Immediate Priorities

### Stable Role in Canada

**Immigration goal**: I'm pursuing permanent residence in Canada through Working Holiday Visa pathway. I need stable employment to make this transition successfully.

**Why Canada specifically**: Natural beauty, environmental values, work-life balance culture, innovation in technology. I want to build my life there long-term, not just try it out.

**This isn't temporary**: Moving internationally is a major commitment. I'm looking for roles where I can establish myself professionally in Canada, not just "any job to get a visa."

## What Makes a Role Valuable to Me

### 1. Opportunities for Meaningful Growth

**Leadership development**: I want roles where I can grow leadership capabilities:
- Taking charge of projects and coordinating teams
- Mentoring other developers
- Making architectural and strategic decisions
- Being the person people come to for guidance

**Leadership transcends technology**: These skills matter whether I'm leading web developers, AI engineers, or robotics teams in the future. I'll invest significant time developing them.

### 2. AI/ML Integration Work

**My sweet spot**: Web applications that incorporate AI/ML capabilities:
- LLM integration (like moh-ami)
- RAG systems (like Folio)
- Recommendation systems (like WhatNow)
- ML-powered features in web products

**Why this matters**: AI in web applications bridges my current expertise (full-stack web dev) with my long-term interests (AI/ML systems). This is genuinely valuable skill building, not just marking time.

### 3. Cross-Functional Collaboration

**What I excel at**: Bridging technical and non-technical teams. The Integrations Dashboard succeeded because I could communicate with both backend developers and sales teams.

**What I enjoy**: This kind of communication and translation work is deeply satisfying. I want roles where this skill is valued and developed further.

### 4. Technical Depth and Quality

**Production systems that last**: Like the Integrations Dashboard (3+ years in production, zero maintenance). I want to build things that provide lasting value, not just ship features that break.

**Architectural thinking**: Roles where I can think about system design, scalability, maintainability. The Nexus Dashboard's foundation blocks architecture is the kind of work I want more of.

## What I Bring

### Immediate Value

**Senior-level capability from day one**:
- 3.5 years production experience
- Shipped systems still running years later
- Mentored other developers
- Led complex projects

**AI/ML expertise most web devs don't have**:
- Built recommendation system with contextual bandits
- Integrated LLMs in production
- Implemented RAG systems
- Understand embeddings and semantic search

**Leadership and communication**:
- Natural "team dad" leadership style
- Bridge builder between teams
- Make people feel capable and supported
- Create psychological safety

### Long-Term Commitment (With Conditions)

**I'll stay as long as I'm growing meaningfully**:
- If there's leadership opportunity: I'll invest years developing that
- If there's AI integration work: That's exactly what I want  
- If I'm valued and developing: I'm committed
- If it's stagnant: We should both reassess

**Not about predetermined timelines**: Quality of opportunity matters more than "exactly 3 years then leave." I evaluate based on whether I'm growing and providing value.

## What I Don't Want

**Roles that are purely maintenance**: If there's no opportunity for growth, leadership, or building new things, I'll get frustrated quickly.

**Stagnant technology**: If the company isn't evolving technically, that's problematic. I need to keep developing relevant skills.

**Toxic culture**: I've worked in supportive environments at Nurtur. I need teams where people respect each other and psychological safety exists.

**Being underutilized**: I have AI/ML skills, leadership capability, and architectural thinking. Roles that don't use those strengths waste my potential.

## Ideal Role Description

**Team structure**: Small motivated team (3-5 people) working on meaningful projects. Everyone believes in the work and contributes excellence.

**My role**: Senior developer with increasing leadership responsibility. Not just coding, but mentoring, architectural decisions, project coordination.

**Technical work**: Full-stack web development with AI/ML integration. Building production systems that matter, not just features that ship.

**Culture**: Results-focused, not process-obsessed. Judge me on what I deliver, not how many hours I sit at a desk. Consensus-based decisions. Professional respect.

**Growth opportunities**: Clear path toward more leadership, more complex technical challenges, deeper AI integration work.

## The Transparent Version for Employers

**Why I'm interested in web dev roles**:
- Canada immigration (need stable employment)
- Leadership opportunities (develop skills that transfer everywhere)
- AI integration bridge (where my skills intersect with interests)
- Financial foundation (save money, establish professionally)

**What you're getting**:
- Senior-level technical capability immediately
- AI/ML expertise to enhance your products
- Leadership and mentoring for your team
- Cross-functional communication skills
- Production-quality delivery

**What I'm getting**:
- Opportunity to grow leadership capabilities
- AI integration work if available
- Platform to be valuable to a team
- Canada immigration pathway
- Financial stability

**How long I'll stay**:
- As long as I'm developing meaningful skills
- As long as I'm providing real value
- As long as growth opportunities exist

This is mutual value exchange. I'll be excellent while I'm here because the skills I develop matter regardless of where my career eventually goes. Leadership, problem-solving, AI integration, team building - these transfer everywhere.

**You get full commitment from someone who'll make your team better. I get opportunity to grow in ways that matter to my long-term career.**

That's honest and fair to everyone involved.
