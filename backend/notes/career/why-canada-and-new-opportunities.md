# Why Canada and New Opportunities

## Immigration to Canada

I'm actively pursuing permanent residence in Canada through the Working Holiday Visa pathway. Canada represents the alignment of my personal values with a place I can build a meaningful life.

## Why Canada Specifically

**Natural beauty and connection to the world**: Canada's vast landscapes, commitment to environmental protection, and culture of outdoor recreation align with my core values. I want to live where my connection to nature (hiking, kayaking, experiencing awe at the world) is supported by the culture and geography.

**Immigration as commitment**: Moving to Canada isn't just about a job - it's about choosing where I want to build my life and career long-term. This commitment means I'm looking for opportunities that grow with me and where I can contribute meaningfully for years.

**Values alignment**: Canadian culture around work-life balance, environmental consciousness, and innovation in technology matches how I want to live and work.

## What I'm Looking For

**Meaningful work in AI, robotics, or exploration technology**: I want to contribute to projects that help people understand and connect with the natural world. Whether that's deep sea exploration, space technology, environmental monitoring, or innovative solutions to ecological challenges.

**Growth opportunity**: I'm building from web development toward AI/robotics systematically. I'm looking for roles where I can:
- Apply my current full-stack skills immediately
- Grow into more AI/ML and systems work over time
- Work on projects with real-world impact
- Learn from experienced engineers in my target fields

**Small, motivated teams**: 3-4 people who all believe in the project and are extremely good at what they do. Everyone has a stake in success and puts aside ego because what we care about is the work.

**Results-focused culture**: "Work that matters, not the process." I want to be judged on what I create, not micromanaged on how I create it. If I need to hike for 2 days with a notebook to solve a problem, that should be fine as long as my work gets done.

## Why Now

**Career progression**: I've been at Nurtur for 2+ years as a Full Stack Developer. I've built production systems like the Integrations Dashboard (3+ years in production with zero maintenance) and contributed to complex projects like the Nexus Dashboard and Email Editor.

**Demonstrated trajectory**: My portfolio shows clear progression:
- Started with web development foundations (Ironhack bootcamp)
- Built increasingly complex full-stack projects (WhatNow with contextual bandits ML)
- Integrated LLMs and AI (moh-ami with OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)
- Explored embedded systems (Atlantis underwater drone)
- Built RAG systems and worked with embeddings (Folio)

**Ready for more**: I'm ready to work on more ambitious projects with stronger alignment to my values. I've proven I can deliver production-quality work, mentor others, and bridge technical and non-technical teams.

## What I Bring to Canadian Employers

- Immediate value with React, TypeScript, Python, full-stack skills
- Proven ability to build stable, long-lasting systems
- Leadership and mentoring capability ("team dad" style)
- Strategic approach to learning and career progression
- Commitment to staying and growing in Canada
- Values-driven work ethic that aligns with meaningful projects
- Range of perspectives (art, teaching, kayaking) that inform technical work

My move to Canada isn't just about finding "a job" - it's about finding where my career can grow in alignment with my values while contributing to projects that matter.
