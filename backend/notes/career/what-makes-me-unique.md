# What Makes Me Unique as a Developer

I think my art background gave me a level of intuition and flexibility that are rare in programmers. I can often tell through gut instinct when a solution is wrong or when the structure of a project is flawed and will produce bugs later on. This intuition saves me significant time and effort compared to people who don't realize there's a problem until they start seeing actual errors. It's like having an early warning system that helps me sense structural issues before they manifest as bugs.

My art background also helps with the idea of failing forward. Art doesn't come with a plan or a set path - you have a vision and feel your way toward it, where failures become creative solutions. Where other developers get frustrated by setbacks or mistakes, I see them as part of the process and usually turn them into something valuable. When I hit a technical constraint or discover my initial approach won't work, I don't get discouraged. I pivot, I adapt, I find creative solutions that sometimes end up better than my original plan.

My leadership style makes me unique too. I found during my time teaching kayaking that most people generally want the same things. In kayaking, students wanted to become better kayakers. In work contexts, people want to make good products. In both situations, people want to be valued, heard, and supported in their growth. I don't think people need to be forced or manipulated to do good work - they just need to be in an environment that lets them do that.

Teaching taught me what people actually need to succeed. The developers I've helped train wanted to learn, they had the tools and the intelligence. They just needed to feel like it was safe to make mistakes and to be able to ask what they thought were silly questions. Creating that safe environment where people can try, fail, learn, and grow is what I do naturally. It's my "team dad" leadership style - not about control or authority, but about making sure everyone has what they need to flourish.

I combine creativity with technical skills the same way I did as an artist. Programming languages and technologies are just tools, the same as brushes and paints. You have a vision to work toward, and everything between you and that goal is just technical challenges and problem-solving. I think art gave me a more flexible outlook on this - I'm less attached to specific tools or approaches and more focused on achieving the vision. If one approach doesn't work, I try another. If a tool isn't right for the job, I learn a new one.

What I can do that other developers might not is bring together technical depth, creative problem-solving, intuitive project sense, and genuine care for the people I work with. I'm not just writing code - I'm building systems that last, solving problems creatively, and helping teams function better. The combination of artistic intuition, teaching experience, and technical skills creates a unique perspective on software development that emphasizes both excellence and empathy.
