# How I Stay Current with Technology

## Goal-Driven Learning (Primary Method)

**I don't learn technologies just to learn them** - I learn what I need to achieve meaningful goals. This keeps me naturally current because I'm always building projects that push my boundaries.

### Recent Examples

**2024-2025**:
- Needed RAG system for Folio → Learned embeddings, semantic search, vector storage
- Needed LLM integration for moh-ami → Learned OpenAI API, prompt engineering, structured outputs
- Needed ML recommendations for WhatNow → Learned contextual bandits, embedding models

**This approach ensures**:
- I learn what's actually useful, not just trendy
- Knowledge sticks because I apply it immediately
- I stay naturally current by pursuing ambitious goals

## Portfolio Projects as Learning Vehicles

**Every personal project targets something new**:
- **WhatNow**: First AI/ML project (contextual bandits)
- **moh-ami**: First LLM integration (GPT-4o-mini)
- **Atlantis**: First embedded systems (LoRa, sensors, hardware)
- **Folio**: First RAG system (embeddings, retrieval)

**Pattern**: Each project deliberately tackles technologies I haven't used before. This forces continuous learning while building portfolio pieces.

## Professional Work Exposure

**At Nurtur (2+ years)**:
- **Nexus Dashboard**: Modern React patterns, foundation blocks architecture
- **Email Editor**: Redux Toolkit (when it was relatively new), Lexical framework
- **Team collaboration**: Learning from senior developers, code reviews, architectural discussions

**Working in professional environments exposes me to**:
- Production-scale challenges (not just tutorial problems)
- Team coding standards and patterns
- Technologies chosen by experienced engineers
- Real-world constraints and trade-offs

## Specific Practices

### 1. Technical Reading (Selective)

**What I read**:
- Official documentation for technologies I'm using (OpenAI docs, React docs, framework changelogs)
- Technical blogs from engineers solving real problems (not just tutorials)
- GitHub issues and discussions for libraries I use
- Release notes for tools in my stack

**What I don't read**:
- General tech news or hype cycles
- "Top 10 frameworks" listicles
- Content designed to generate clicks rather than teach

**Time investment**: ~2-3 hours per week of focused reading when I'm using a new technology, less when maintaining stable skills.

### 2. Building Over Consuming

**80/20 rule**: 80% of my time building, 20% reading/learning.

Most developers do the opposite (reading endlessly about frameworks they never use). I learn by doing - read enough to start, then build, then read more when stuck.

### 3. Following Developments in My Focus Areas

**Targeted following**:
- AI/ML developments (LLMs, embeddings, RAG techniques) because it's my career direction
- React ecosystem because it's my current professional tool
- Embedded systems and robotics because it's my long-term goal

**Ignore**:
- Languages I'm not using (Go, Rust, etc.) - will learn if needed
- Frameworks outside my stack (Vue, Angular) - know they exist, don't follow closely
- Technologies that don't serve my career trajectory

### 4. Community and Discussion (Minimal But Targeted)

**I'm not very active in tech communities**, but I do:
- Read GitHub discussions for libraries I use
- Occasionally ask questions when stuck on specific problems
- Follow specific engineers whose work aligns with my interests

**Why minimal**: I learn more by building than by discussing in abstract. I'm better at learning from doing than from debate.

### 5. Experimentation in Side Projects

**Folio is a perfect example**: I'm learning RAG, embeddings, and semantic search not because I need it for work, but because I want to understand these technologies for future career direction.

**Pattern**: Side projects let me experiment with technologies before they're required for work. This means I'm ahead of the curve when opportunities arise.

## What "Staying Current" Means to Me

**Not**: Chasing every new framework or knowing all the latest trends.

**Instead**: 
- Deep understanding of core concepts that transfer across technologies
- Practical experience with tools relevant to my career direction
- Ability to learn quickly when needed
- Awareness of what exists without needing to know everything

## How I Decide What to Learn

### 1. Does it serve my goals?
If I'm building toward AI/robotics/exploration technology, learning that new CSS framework isn't a priority. Learning about LLMs, embeddings, or embedded systems is.

### 2. Is it practical, not just trendy?
I learned contextual bandits not because they're trendy (they're not), but because they solved a real problem for WhatNow.

### 3. Can I apply it immediately?
I don't learn technologies "in case I need them someday." I learn them when I have a project that needs them.

### 4. Does it have staying power?
I focus on fundamental concepts that will remain relevant (embeddings, semantic search, ML fundamentals) over specific tools that might be replaced.

## Adapting to Rapid Change

**Tech changes fast, but fundamentals don't**:
- React's API changes, but component thinking remains
- LLM APIs evolve, but prompt engineering principles stay
- Frameworks come and go, but good architecture patterns persist

**My strategy**: Deep understanding of fundamentals + rapid learning of specifics when needed.

**Example**: I learned Redux Toolkit for Nurtur work within days because I already understood state management principles. The specific API was just syntax.

## Staying Current Without Burnout

**Sustainable approach**:
- Learn through projects I'm excited about (not obligated study)
- Focus on my career trajectory (not everything)
- Build things that matter (not tutorials for their own sake)
- Take breaks (hiking, nature) - rest enables learning

**What I don't do**:
- ❌ Constant hustle culture "learn new framework every week"
- ❌ FOMO about technologies I'm not using
- ❌ Forcing myself through courses on topics that don't interest me
- ❌ Sacrificing work-life balance to "stay current"

## The Result

**I'm current in what matters**:
- AI/ML (embeddings, LLMs, RAG, contextual bandits)
- Modern React patterns (hooks, functional components, Redux Toolkit)
- Full-stack development (Python, TypeScript, FastAPI, Next.js)
- Beginning embedded systems experience (Atlantis project)

**I'm deliberately not current in**:
- Technologies outside my focus (mobile development, game engines)
- Every new JavaScript framework
- Blockchain/crypto (not aligned with my values or goals)

**This is strategic, not ignorance**: I could learn these if needed, but they don't serve my trajectory toward exploration technology.

## The Philosophy

**"People who stop learning are the ones who stop making bigger, more exciting goals."**

I stay current not by frantically consuming every new technology, but by continuously pursuing ambitious goals that require me to learn what matters. When you're always building toward something bigger, staying current happens naturally.
