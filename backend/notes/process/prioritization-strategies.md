# Prioritization Strategies

## Core Philosophy: Work That Matters

My approach to prioritization centers on **"work that matters, not the process."** Focus on what actually creates value, not what looks busy or follows rigid procedures.

## Prioritization Framework

### 1. Align with Goals

**I'm always pursuing goals**: Everything I prioritize should serve a meaningful objective. If a task doesn't move me toward my goals, I question whether it's worth doing.

**What's the real outcome?**: Not "write more code" but "make the sales team 50% more productive" (Integrations Dashboard). Not "add a feature" but "help users discover experiences they'll love" (WhatNow).

### 2. Value vs. Effort

**High value, low effort**: Do these first. Quick wins that provide real benefit.

**High value, high effort**: These are the meaningful projects worth investing in. The Integrations Dashboard was high effort, but the value (3+ years in production with zero maintenance) justified it.

**Low value, low effort**: Only if they unblock something important or take minutes.

**Low value, high effort**: Avoid or eliminate. These are traps that waste time without providing meaningful return.

### 3. User Impact

**Who benefits and how much?**: The Integrations Dashboard served the entire sales team daily. That broad, frequent impact made it high priority.

**Is this solving a real problem?**: When building the Email Editor, we prioritized features that addressed actual pain points in the content creation workflow, not features that sounded cool.

### 4. Dependencies and Blockers

**What unlocks other work?**: Sometimes low-value tasks become high priority because they unblock high-value work. The foundation blocks architecture for Nexus was prerequisite work that enabled faster dashboard development later.

**What's blocking the team?**: If my teammates can't proceed without something from me, that moves up in priority even if it's not the most interesting work.

## Practical Application

### Daily/Weekly Prioritization

**Start with highest impact**: What will move the needle most? On Nexus, that meant focusing on developer experience and safety layers because they amplified everyone's productivity.

**Group similar tasks**: Context switching is expensive. If I need to fix three CSS issues, do them together rather than scattering them across days.

**Protect deep focus time**: Some problems need sustained attention. I prioritize uninterrupted blocks for complex work over constant small tasks.

### When Everything Is "Urgent"

**Challenge the urgency**: Is this actually urgent or just loud? Real urgency means significant negative consequences if delayed.

**Frame the limits**: What can't be changed? What are the real constraints? Often "urgent" problems become manageable when you understand the actual deadlines and dependencies.

**Propose tradeoffs**: "If this is urgent, we'll need to delay X. Is that acceptable?" Making tradeoffs explicit helps stakeholders prioritize realistically.

### Long-term Prioritization

**Career trajectory**: I'm building from web development → AI/ML → robotics deliberately. Project choices should advance this progression. WhatNow taught me contextual bandits. moh-ami taught me LLM integration. Each project strategically builds skills toward my exploration technology goal.

**Values alignment**: "I don't want to work for money alone." I prioritize projects that align with my values of wonder and connection. This makes work sustainable and meaningful.

## When Priorities Conflict

### Team vs. Personal Growth

Generally **team needs come first** in the short term, but I communicate when my long-term growth needs attention.

**Example**: If I'm stuck on React work but need to grow Python skills, I look for opportunities to contribute backend work or build Python skills in side projects.

### Quality vs. Speed

**Depends on the stakes**: The Integrations Dashboard needed to be rock solid because the sales team would depend on it daily. I prioritized quality, which paid off (3+ years, zero maintenance).

For prototypes or experiments, speed matters more. I can iterate quickly and fix issues as they arise.

**Innovation and practicality can be the same thing**: The best solutions are both elegant and maintainable. I aim for that sweet spot rather than treating quality and speed as always opposing.

### Stakeholder Conflicts

**Facilitate consensus**: My team prefers decisions by consensus. When stakeholders have conflicting priorities, I help them see each other's perspectives and find solutions that serve shared goals.

**Focus on project success**: "Puts aside ego because what we care about is the project." Reminding everyone of the shared goal often resolves priority conflicts.

## Tools and Techniques

**Goal-driven learning**: I don't learn technologies for their own sake. I learn what I need to achieve meaningful objectives. This keeps my learning focused and relevant.

**"Is this done?"**: My artistic background helps me sense when something is complete - when further work is perfectionism rather than practical improvement. This prevents over-investing in diminishing returns.

**Intuition about project structure**: I can feel when something is weak in the architecture or approach. This intuition helps me prioritize strengthening weak areas before they become critical problems.

## What I Don't Prioritize

**Busywork**: Tasks that exist to satisfy process rather than create value. I'll push back respectfully when asked to do work that doesn't serve real goals.

**Politics**: I'd rather invest energy in solving problems than navigating office politics. I focus on creating value and helping teammates, which builds natural credibility.

**Perfection**: "Done" is better than "perfect." The Integrations Dashboard wasn't perfect, but it was excellent and it shipped. Perfectionism is the enemy of shipping.

## The Goal

Prioritize work that creates real value, aligns with meaningful goals, and moves the needle for users and teammates. Everything else is negotiable.

My approach: **goal-driven, value-focused, and willing to say no to work that doesn't matter**.
