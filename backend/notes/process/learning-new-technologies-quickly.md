# Learning New Technologies Quickly

## Goal-Driven Learning

**I'm always pursuing goals**: Learning happens naturally when working toward meaningful objectives. I don't learn technologies for their own sake - I learn what I need to achieve something that inspires me.

## My Learning Process

### 1. Start with a Concrete Goal

**I taught myself all my coding languages** not through courses or structured curricula, but through projects I wanted to build:
- **Java**: Learned before university because I wanted to understand AI concepts
- **Python**: Taught myself to work with Arduinos and build embedded systems
- **C#**: Learned to make games in Unity
- **React/TypeScript**: Learned through Ironhack bootcamp and building real projects
- **Contextual bandits**: Learned for WhatNow when I needed recommendation systems
- **LLM integration**: Learned for moh-ami when I needed AI-assisted legal research
- **RAG systems**: Learning for Folio to build an intelligent chatbot

Each skill emerged from a goal that inspired me, not from abstract desire to "learn something."

### 2. Find the Fundamentals

**Teach basic principles and work up**: I don't try to learn everything at once. I identify the core concepts that unlock the rest.

**For a new framework**:
- What problem does it solve?
- What's the mental model? (e.g., React's component lifecycle, Redux's unidirectional data flow)
- What are the 20% of features I'll use 80% of the time?
- Where's the official documentation?

**For a new language**:
- How do I structure code? (functions, classes, modules)
- How do I handle data? (types, structures, manipulation)
- What are the idioms? (how do experienced developers write it)
- What are the gotchas? (common mistakes)

### 3. Build Something Real Immediately

**Learn by doing, not by reading**: I read enough to start, then build something that matters. I learn far more from encountering real problems than from tutorials.

**Examples**:
- **WhatNow**: Jumped into contextual bandits by implementing a basic version, breaking it, learning why, improving it
- **moh-ami**: Started with OpenAI API basics, then built increasingly sophisticated prompts and error handling
- **Email Editor**: Learned Lexical framework by actually building the link editor component for production

### 4. Iterate Through Confusion

**The biggest problem in learning is feeling like you'll never get it**: When I teach CSS to backend developers, I emphasize that confusion is temporary. Everyone feels lost at first.

**My approach to confusion**:
- Accept that I won't understand everything immediately
- Focus on making something work, even if I don't fully understand why yet
- Gradually build mental models through experimentation
- Ask "why does this work?" once I have something working

**I don't think you ever really master a skill**: You just learn enough to reach your current goals. When you make bigger goals, you learn more. This mindset removes pressure to "master" something before using it.

### 5. Learn from Examples

**Read other people's code**: For moh-ami's LLM integration, I studied OpenAI's examples and other developers' approaches before implementing my own version.

**But understand, don't copy**: I want to know WHY they made certain choices, not just WHAT they did. Understanding principles lets me adapt solutions to my specific needs.

### 6. Teach to Solidify

**Teaching forces clarity**: When I mentor backend developers learning CSS or explain technical concepts to sales teams, I have to truly understand something to explain it clearly.

**If I can't explain it simply, I don't understand it well enough**: Teaching reveals gaps in my knowledge and forces me to fill them.

## Speed Factors

### What Makes Me Fast

**Pattern recognition**: After learning multiple languages and frameworks, I recognize common patterns. A new framework's "component" is similar to concepts I already know.

**Strong fundamentals**: Understanding programming principles deeply means I can learn syntax and APIs quickly. The hard part (algorithmic thinking, system design) is already developed.

**Intuition**: My artistic background gives me intuition about when something "feels right" or when I'm on the wrong path. This intuition speeds up learning by guiding my exploration.

**Self-direction**: I don't need external structure or motivation. If I need to learn something to achieve a goal, I'll find a way to learn it.

### Example: Learning in Context

**Atlantis project**: Needed to learn:
- LoRa communication protocols
- Embedded systems programming
- Hardware-software integration
- Sensor calibration

I learned each as needed to solve specific problems: "The probe needs to communicate with the base station" → research LoRa → implement basic communication → iterate when it doesn't work → understand the protocol more deeply.

## When Learning Is Hard

**Take breaks and let it process**: Sometimes I solve problems or understand concepts while hiking or away from the computer. Subconscious processing is powerful.

**Find different explanations**: If one tutorial or documentation doesn't click, find another. Everyone explains differently, and one will match how I think.

**Build from first principles**: When completely stuck, go back to basics. What am I actually trying to accomplish? What's the simplest possible version?

## What I'm NOT Good At

**Passive learning**: Watching long video tutorials or reading textbooks without applying them doesn't work well for me. I learn by doing.

**Learning without purpose**: If I don't have a goal that requires the skill, learning feels abstract and doesn't stick. I need a meaningful project to drive learning.

## Continuous Growth

**People who stop learning are the ones who stop making bigger, more exciting goals**: My career progression (web dev → AI/ML → embedded → robotics → exploration) ensures I'm always learning because I'm always reaching for something just beyond my current capability.

**Self-directed learning is a superpower**: Many developers wait for training or permission to learn new things. I teach myself whatever I need to achieve my goals. This makes me adaptable and fast.

## The Result

I learned web development through Ironhack bootcamp, then:
- Built production systems at Nurtur (Integrations, Nexus, Email Editor)
- Taught myself contextual bandits for WhatNow
- Integrated LLMs for moh-ami
- Explored embedded systems for Atlantis
- Built RAG systems for Folio

All within a few years, through goal-driven, hands-on learning. That's how I learn fast: **pick ambitious goals, learn what I need to achieve them, build something real immediately, and iterate through confusion.**
