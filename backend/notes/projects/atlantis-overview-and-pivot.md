# Atlantis: Lake Bed Mapping System and Strategic Pivot

Atlantis, formally known as "The Momo," is a lake bed mapping system that demonstrates advanced engineering for impossible-to-reach places. The project underwent a major strategic pivot from an underwater drone to a surface boat with towed probe mapping system, representing sophisticated problem-solving and adaptation in hardware development.

The current system consists of a remote-controlled surface boat that tows a weighted probe equipped with eight ultrasonic sensors arranged in a hemispherical array. The boat uses GPS positioning and a winch system to control probe depth, while the probe sends detailed mapping data back via LoRa long-range communication. This creates highly accurate 3D maps of lake beds and submerged structures at a fraction of professional equipment costs.

The project began as an ambitious underwater drone concept using a Raspberry Pi 4 for processing and Raspberry Pi Pico for real-time sensor control. The hybrid architecture combined Python for high-level AI and C++ for low-level hardware control. The original design included four brushless motors for propulsion, IMU sensors for orientation, pressure sensors for depth measurement, ultrasonic obstacle detection, and a camera system for underwater photography. The budget was optimized to $487 CAD within a $500 target.

The pivot happened in October 2025 when I realized the underwater drone approach had fundamental complexity issues. Waterproofing at depth, real-time communication underwater, and safe recovery systems created overwhelming challenges. More importantly, for the actual goal of mapping lake beds, a surface boat with a towed probe offered superior advantages in accuracy, reliability, cost, and safety. This recognition led to completely reimagining the system architecture.

The new approach eliminates waterproofing challenges for the main electronics by keeping the boat on the surface. The towed probe is simpler to waterproof as a single sealed unit with no moving parts. Cable length plus cable angle gives accurate depth measurement without pressure sensors. The probe only needs to send data one way, not receive commands, which dramatically simplifies communication. If something fails, the probe can simply be winched back to the boat rather than needing underwater recovery systems.

The technical innovation is striking. Professional lake mapping equipment costs $50,000 to $200,000 and provides accuracy of plus or minus 10 to 50 centimeters with resolution detecting 10 to 50 centimeter objects. My system aims for accuracy of plus or minus 1 to 2 centimeters with resolution detecting 5 to 10 centimeter objects, all at a cost of $500 to $2,000. This is possible because eight ultrasonic sensors covering a hemisphere provide extremely dense point cloud data, and stopping the boat at measurement points eliminates motion artifacts.

The philosophy guiding Atlantis is "Survivability Over Perfection" - creating tools robust enough to access environments requiring genuine engineering skill to reach. Success is measured by the system's ability to safely map lake beds and return valuable data from inaccessible underwater environments. The project embodies engineering for impossible places, demonstrating hardware integration, embedded systems programming, sensor fusion, and risk management.

The existing components from the underwater drone phase can be largely repurposed. The Raspberry Pi 3B (discovered to be a Pi 3B with 1GB RAM rather than the expected Pi 4B with 4GB) can control the boat systems. The sensors, motors, and 3D printing equipment acquired for the drone work perfectly for the new mapping system. Even setbacks like ordering the wrong Raspberry Pi model taught valuable lessons about verifying hardware specifications and adapting development approaches to available resources.

What makes this project particularly valuable for a portfolio is the strategic pivot demonstration. Recognizing when an approach isn't working and having the confidence to radically change direction shows engineering maturity. The ability to repurpose existing components rather than starting from scratch demonstrates resourcefulness. The new system is simpler, more reliable, and better suited to the actual goal - exactly the kind of pragmatic engineering employers value.

The project draws direct parallels to space exploration, particularly Mars rover operations. Operating in environments where real-time communication is impossible or impractical requires autonomous decision-making, comprehensive safety systems, and robust failure recovery. These same challenges exist underwater. The solution strategies I developed mirror those used in planetary exploration, demonstrating systems thinking that transcends specific domains.

From a technical portfolio perspective, Atlantis showcases hardware integration skills beyond typical web development. Working with LoRa communication, GPS positioning, winch control systems, ultrasonic sensor arrays, and 3D printing demonstrates breadth. The project required learning embedded systems, RF communication protocols, spatial data processing, and mechanical design. This breadth combined with the depth of the strategic pivot and technical innovation makes Atlantis a compelling portfolio piece.

What I'm most proud of is that Atlantis solves a real problem in a genuinely novel way. Professional lake mapping is expensive and often overkill for small projects. Recreational divers want to know what's down there before committing to dives. Environmental researchers need affordable monitoring tools. My system provides professional-grade data at consumer prices by rethinking the problem from first principles rather than copying existing approaches.

The project is fully documented through 63 chat records spanning September through December 2025, tracking every technical decision, challenge, and solution. The documentation includes component research, sensor testing results, strategic planning sessions, the major pivot decision, and ongoing development of the LoRa communication system. This comprehensive documentation proves the depth and authenticity of the work.

Atlantis represents the journey from ambitious vision through technical challenges to pragmatic innovation. The willingness to pivot when evidence demanded it, the ability to see better solutions through first-principles thinking, and the persistence to build something genuinely novel all demonstrate the engineering mindset I bring to every project.
