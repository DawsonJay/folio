# Atlantis: Hardware Evolution and Strategic Pivot Journey

The hardware evolution of Atlantis tells the story of adaptation, learning from setbacks, and recognizing when to fundamentally change direction. The project's journey from underwater drone to surface boat mapping system demonstrates engineering maturity and the importance of responding to evidence rather than stubbornly pursuing initial plans.

The project began in early 2025 with an ambitious vision: build an autonomous underwater exploration drone for $500 CAD. The planned architecture used a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM for high-level processing and AI, combined with a Raspberry Pi Pico for real-time sensor control and motor management. This hybrid approach separated concerns - Python on the Pi 4 handled navigation and decision-making while C++ on the Pico handled time-critical hardware control with microsecond precision.

The component procurement happened in stages. Stage 1 in August 2025 brought the core electronics: Raspberry Pi (expected Pi 4), Raspberry Pi Pico, MPU6050 IMU sensor for orientation, BMP280 pressure sensors for depth measurement, QMC5883L compass for navigation, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection, and various supporting components. I meticulously documented everything with 27 photos and detailed technical analysis files, establishing professional documentation practices that would prove valuable throughout the project.

The first major discovery came when I actually examined the Raspberry Pi. It was a Pi 3B with 1GB RAM, not the Pi 4B with 4GB I expected. This severely limited the AI capabilities I'd planned for autonomous navigation and computer vision. Rather than seeing this as a project-killing problem, I adapted the development strategy. Focus first on the core nervous system - basic navigation, sensor reading, motor control - and plan to upgrade to Pi 4B later for advanced AI features. This phased approach turned a setback into a more realistic development path.

Stage 1 sensor testing validated that all sensors worked correctly. The MPU6050 provided accelerometer and gyroscope data for orientation. The BMP280 measured pressure and temperature for depth calculation. The QMC5883L gave compass heading for navigation. The HC-SR04 detected obstacles with ultrasonic ranging. I developed comprehensive testing scripts and resolved library issues, establishing confidence in the sensor suite.

Stage 2 in September 2025 brought the propulsion system: four brushless motors for thrust, electronic speed controllers for motor control, a 6000mAh LiPo battery for power, a battery management system for safety, and a power distribution board with integrated voltage regulators. The components formed a complete power chain from battery through BMS through PDB to ESCs to motors, validated for electrical compatibility before any assembly.

The development strategy embraced blind exploration inspired by Mars rovers. Deep reservoirs in the Peak District of England (35-41 meters depth) were the target environment. Real-time underwater communication would require expensive equipment, so I planned for autonomous operation with periodic surfacing to transmit data. The drone would explore using camera-based navigation, build local maps, execute pre-planned grid patterns, and surface regularly to communicate findings. Multiple safety systems would ensure recovery if anything failed.

In September 2025, I acquired a Creality Ender 3 V3 SE 3D printer and ELEGOO PLA+ filament, shifting from external case printing to self-manufacturing. This gave me complete control over the iterative design process and eliminated dependency on external printing services. The printer's 220x220x250mm build volume required modular design for larger components, but the auto-leveling and automatic filament loading made it beginner-friendly for learning 3D printing alongside the electronics work.

The underwater drone architecture grew increasingly complex. Waterproofing the hull required perfect seals around motor shafts, camera housing, sensor penetrations, and access panels. Pressure at depth put stress on all enclosures. Communication underwater required expensive specialized equipment. Ballast systems for depth control needed precise calibration. Recovery systems in case of failure had to work reliably at depth. The engineering challenges were solvable but mounting.

The pivot came in October 2025 when I stepped back and questioned the fundamental approach. The goal was mapping lake beds to find interesting submerged structures. Did that actually require an underwater drone? What if I kept the boat on the surface and towed a probe below? The probe could be much simpler - just sensors in a sealed sphere. The boat carries GPS and winch for positioning. Cable length and angle give depth. The probe only sends data up via the cable, no complex wireless communication needed.

This insight triggered a complete strategic reimagining. The surface boat plus towed probe eliminated most of the hard problems with the underwater drone. No complex waterproofing of moving parts. No underwater communication challenges. Simple recovery by winching up the probe. GPS positioning from the surface boat. Simpler power management. The new architecture was just... better. More reliable, more accurate, safer, and actually simpler to build despite sounding more complex.

The existing components repurposed beautifully. The Raspberry Pi 3B, adequate for boat control systems and GPS processing. The sensors, perfect for the probe and boat. The motors, could drive the surface boat or winch system. The 3D printer, essential for controller enclosure and probe housing. Even the failed underwater drone work had taught me sensor integration, power management, waterproofing principles, and safety system design. Nothing was wasted.

The December 2025 work focused on the LoRa communication system for the controller. The original SX1276 module at 915 MHz was damaged from multiple resoldering attempts during development experimentation. Finding replacements proved difficult, so I evaluated alternatives and switched to SX1278 at 433 MHz for better availability and potentially better long-range performance. The SX1278 is register-compatible with SX1276 so code changes were minimal - just updating the frequency constant.

What makes this hardware evolution story valuable for a portfolio is what it demonstrates about engineering thinking. I didn't let the sunk cost fallacy trap me in the underwater drone approach. When evidence showed a better path, I took it. I adapted to setbacks like the wrong Pi model rather than giving up. I repurposed existing work and components rather than starting over. I learned from every stage - sensor testing, power system validation, 3D printing acquisition - and applied those lessons to the evolved design.

The technical breadth is impressive: embedded Linux on Raspberry Pi, real-time programming on Pico, sensor integration across I2C and SPI, power electronics and motor control, RF communication with LoRa, GPS positioning, winch control systems, 3D printing and mechanical design, and Python for high-level control. This is hardware engineering combined with software engineering in service of a concrete goal.

The project documentation captures the entire journey through 63 chat records spanning September through December 2025. Every technical decision, failed experiment, successful test, component order, and strategic pivot is documented in detail. This creates a compelling narrative of actual engineering work: identifying problems, developing solutions, testing hypotheses, learning from failures, and ultimately succeeding by being willing to fundamentally rethink the approach.

From an employer perspective, the hardware evolution demonstrates adaptability, practical problem-solving, willingness to change course based on evidence, resourcefulness in repurposing existing work, persistence through setbacks, and breadth of technical skills. These are exactly the qualities that make engineers valuable: the ability to navigate ambiguity, learn new domains, and deliver working solutions despite challenges.

Atlantis proves I can work beyond web development in embedded systems, hardware integration, RF communication, and electromechanical design. Combined with my AI/ML work in WhatNow and moh-ami, my web development expertise from Nexus and Integrations Dashboard, and my design thinking from the Portfolio Website, Atlantis completes a picture of an engineer who can work across the full stack from silicon to user interface and isn't afraid to learn whatever a project requires.
