# Cirrus: Project Scoping Lessons and Ambition Management

The scoping lessons from Cirrus provided valuable insights about matching project ambition to realistic completion prospects. Learning when to pursue ambitious goals versus when to constrain scope is critical for actually finishing projects rather than accumulating indefinitely-in-progress work.

The initial ambition of building a Canadian weather prediction system was exciting but ultimately unrealistic for a solo developer without meteorological expertise or institutional resources. Weather forecasting is difficult enough that professional organizations with large teams struggle. Attempting to build a competitive system alone was hubris born from underestimating problem complexity.

The scope creep recognition came as understanding the full requirements. Not just building ML models but also acquiring comprehensive data, validating predictions rigorously, handling real-time updates, designing for reliability, and achieving accuracy exceeding existing systems. Each requirement expanded the project scope until the realistic time to completion became years of full-time work.

The domain expertise gap became apparent as work progressed. Understanding meteorology deeply enough to know whether models were capturing real weather dynamics rather than spurious correlations required knowledge I didn't have. Domain expertise can't be substituted with coding ability for problems deeply embedded in specialized knowledge domains.

The data infrastructure reality showed that serious data problems require serious solutions. Ongoing data acquisition from multiple sources, cleaning and validation, storage for historical analysis, and real-time processing all needed robust infrastructure. Personal projects struggle with this infrastructure overhead that organizations handle with dedicated teams.

The pivot decision to cancel rather than continue indefinitely demonstrated willingness to cut losses. The sunk cost fallacy tempts continuing investment in failing projects because you've already invested so much. Having the discipline to stop when evidence shows infeasibility prevents wasting more time on unrealistic goals.

The lessons applied to subsequent project scoping. WhatNow targeted movie recommendations - complex enough to be interesting but constrained enough to be achievable. Atlantis pivoted from ambitious underwater drone to practical surface boat mapping. Folio focused narrowly on portfolio chatbot rather than general assistant. These realistic scoping decisions reflected Cirrus lessons about ambition management.

The portfolio value of cancelled projects includes demonstrating learning from setbacks, honest assessment of what went wrong, judgment about when to stop, and growth from experience. Employers value engineers who learn from failures rather than repeating them. The ability to discuss Cirrus cancellation openly shows self-awareness and continuous improvement.

The ambition management skill distinguishes engineers who ship from those who perpetually work on grand visions never completed. Understanding which problems are tractable alone versus which require teams or institutional resources guides which projects to pursue. This judgment is developed through experience including failed attempts like Cirrus.
