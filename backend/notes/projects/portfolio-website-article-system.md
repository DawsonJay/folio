# Portfolio Website: Article System and Content Architecture

The article system in the Portfolio Website provides sophisticated content presentation with navigation, table of contents, code blocks, demo integrations, and reading experience optimization. This content infrastructure demonstrates understanding that portfolios need both visual appeal and substantive technical content.

The article reader interface creates focused distraction-free reading experience. The two-panel layout shows contents navigation alongside article content. The scroll tracking highlights current section in table of contents. The smooth scrolling to sections on click improves navigation. This reader design shows attention to content consumption experience beyond just displaying text.

The article components create consistent rich content formatting. TitleBlock for section headers. TextBlock for body content. CodeBlock with syntax highlighting. DemoBlock for embedding interactive demonstrations. ArticleBlock as base component. This component library enables rich formatted technical content without HTML in markdown files.

The table of contents generation automatically extracts headings creating navigable structure. The contents menu provides overview of article structure. The active section highlighting shows reading progress. The click-to-section navigation enables jumping to specific content. This navigation infrastructure makes long-form technical content approachable and explorable.

The project deep dives provide comprehensive technical documentation. Each project has multiple article sections covering different aspects. The overview introduces the project. Technical articles dive into implementation details. Challenge articles discuss problems and solutions. This multi-faceted documentation provides depth beyond typical portfolio project descriptions.

The demo integration embeds interactive demonstrations directly in articles. The demo blocks show WhatNow, moh-ami, and other project demos inline with explanatory text. This integration enables readers to try actual working projects while learning about them, combining explanation with hands-on experience. The demo embedding demonstrates technical capability to integrate disparate systems.

The code presentation with syntax highlighting makes technical examples readable. The code blocks support multiple languages. The formatting preserves indentation and structure. The highlighting emphasizes syntax. This code presentation shows understanding that technical portfolios need to present code clearly for technical audiences evaluating implementation quality.

The reading experience optimization improves long-form content consumption. The typography sizing and spacing optimize readability. The line length limits prevent too-wide text. The scroll behavior feels smooth. The section transitions guide attention. These micro-optimizations show understanding that content presentation quality affects whether people actually read the content.

The content organization provides progressive disclosure from overview to deep technical detail. Project menu shows all projects. Project preview panels provide high-level summaries. Project pages offer comprehensive documentation. Article sections dive into specific technical topics. This layered information architecture lets users explore to their interest level rather than overwhelming everyone with everything.
