# Atlantis: LoRa Communication System with DNA-Style Error Correction

The LoRa communication system in Atlantis represents one of the most sophisticated aspects of the project, implementing long-range wireless communication with novel DNA-inspired error correction for reliable data transmission over 5 to 20 kilometer distances across lakes and reservoirs.

LoRa (Long Range) is a wireless communication technology designed specifically for low-power, long-distance transmission. Unlike WiFi or Bluetooth that work over meters, LoRa can communicate over kilometers while using minimal power. This makes it perfect for the surface boat and probe system where the boat might be hundreds of meters or even kilometers away from the controller on shore during mapping operations.

The system uses 433 MHz LoRa modules based on the Semtech SX1278 chipset, specifically the Ai-Thinker RA-02 breakout boards. I originally planned for 915 MHz but switched to 433 MHz for better component availability and potentially better long-range performance at that frequency band. The modules communicate via SPI interface with the Arduino Nano controller, using MOSI, MISO, SCK, NSS, RST, and DIO0 pins for complete control.

The controller is phone-sized with an e-paper display, joystick, and buttons. It sends commands to control the boat and receives mapping data from the probe. The system architecture uses one-way communication from probe to boat for mapping data, which simplifies the protocol and improves reliability. Commands go from controller to boat for navigation and winch control.

What makes the Atlantis LoRa system unique is the DNA-style error correction protocol I designed. In DNA, genetic information is protected through redundancy - multiple copies of important sequences exist so damage to one copy doesn't lose the information. I apply this same principle to data transmission. Each data packet is sent 30 times with majority voting to determine the correct value. If 30 packets are sent and 20 say "sensor reading = 5.2m" while 10 are corrupted, the system accepts 5.2m as correct.

This 30x redundancy provides extraordinary reliability even in challenging RF environments. Lake surfaces create multipath interference where radio signals bounce off water and terrain. Weather conditions affect signal propagation. Physical obstructions like trees or hills can block direct line of sight. Traditional communication protocols struggle in these conditions, but the DNA-style error correction handles them gracefully by ensuring correct data gets through even when many individual packets fail.

The trade-off is bandwidth for reliability. Sending each measurement 30 times means the effective data rate is 1/30th of the raw transmission speed. For Atlantis this trade-off is perfect because mapping data is relatively small - sensor readings, GPS coordinates, orientation data - and measurements happen slowly as the boat stops to take readings. I don't need high bandwidth; I need guaranteed correctness. A single wrong measurement corrupts the entire 3D map.

The implementation required learning RF communication protocols, understanding how SPI interfaces work, and developing custom packet protocols for error detection and correction. The SX1278 chipset provides basic LoRa modulation and transmission, but the higher-level protocol for packaging data, detecting errors, implementing retransmission, and performing majority voting is all custom code I developed specifically for Atlantis.

One practical challenge was component selection. The original SX1276 module at 915 MHz was suspected damaged from multiple resoldering attempts during development. Finding replacements proved difficult as 915 MHz modules had limited availability. I evaluated alternatives including the newer SX1262 chipset on a development board, but that would have required significant code changes. The SX1278 at 433 MHz offered the best balance - it's register-compatible with the SX1276 so code changes were minimal (just updating the frequency constant), modules were readily available, and the lower frequency potentially offers better long-range performance.

The 2-pack of modules provides one for the controller and one for testing and development. Having a second module allows me to test the communication system on the bench before integrating it into the boat, validating that the DNA-style error correction works correctly and measuring actual range and reliability under different conditions.

The range requirements come from the mapping use case. Typical lakes and reservoirs where I plan to use Atlantis are a few hundred meters to several kilometers across. The controller needs to work from shore while the boat operates in the middle of the lake. The 5 to 20 kilometer range that 433 MHz LoRa provides offers plenty of margin, ensuring reliable communication even in challenging conditions or with obstructions.

From a technical portfolio perspective, the LoRa system demonstrates understanding of wireless communication principles, ability to work with RF hardware, creative problem-solving through the DNA-inspired error correction, and systems integration skills combining hardware and custom protocols. It shows I can work at low levels with hardware SPI interfaces while also designing high-level protocols for reliability.

The error correction approach specifically demonstrates first-principles thinking. Rather than using existing error correction algorithms like Reed-Solomon or Hamming codes, I identified the core requirement (reliability in noisy environments) and designed a solution inspired by biological systems. This kind of creative cross-domain thinking is exactly what makes engineering interesting and effective.

What I learned from developing the LoRa system is that reliable communication is harder than it seems. In ideal conditions with clear line of sight and no interference, even simple protocols work fine. But real-world environments are messy. The DNA-style error correction represents accepting that messiness and building systems that work anyway. This philosophy of designing for real-world conditions rather than ideal assumptions applies far beyond RF communication.

The LoRa system is documented through recent development work including module selection, frequency migration from 915 MHz to 433 MHz, code development for the protocols, and testing procedures. The December 2025 chat records capture the decision-making process around component replacement and frequency selection, showing how practical constraints inform technical choices.

The LoRa communication system embodies several key engineering principles: design for reliability over performance, use redundancy intelligently, learn from other domains (biology), and make pragmatic choices based on component availability and project constraints. These principles make Atlantis not just a mapping system but a demonstration of mature engineering thinking.
