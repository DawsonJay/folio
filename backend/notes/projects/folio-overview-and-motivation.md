# Folio: AI-Powered RAG Portfolio Chatbot

Folio is an AI-powered portfolio chatbot that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions about my background, skills, and projects. The system represents the cutting edge of my AI/ML capabilities combined with full-stack development expertise, demonstrating modern AI application architecture in a production-ready system.

The core motivation for building Folio came from recognizing that traditional portfolios are passive documents. Employers read what you write in the order you wrote it. They can't ask follow-up questions. They can't drill into specific projects that interest them. They get the same generic information everyone sees. This mismatch between how employers want to evaluate candidates (through conversation and questions) and how portfolios present information (through static content) creates friction.

Folio solves this by making my portfolio conversational and interactive. Employers can ask natural language questions like "Tell me about your React experience" or "What was the biggest technical challenge in WhatNow?" The system retrieves relevant information from my atomic notes knowledge base and generates personalized answers maintaining my authentic first-person voice. Follow-up questions drill deeper. Different employers get different information based on what they care about. The portfolio adapts to the conversation rather than forcing everyone through the same linear narrative.

The technical architecture combines several modern AI technologies. LangChain orchestrates the RAG workflow, handling retrieval, prompt construction, and response generation. OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model (1536 dimensions) generates semantic embeddings from text, enabling similarity-based search. Local JSON file storage with NumPy similarity calculations handles vector search for my dataset size. OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini generates the actual chat responses using retrieved context. The frontend uses React with TypeScript for the chat interface. The backend uses FastAPI providing API endpoints for chat and suggestions.

The atomic notes approach is central to Folio's design. Instead of long articles or documents, the knowledge base consists of self-contained 200-500 token notes each covering a single coherent topic. Notes are written in first person as if I'm speaking directly to the interviewer. Each note includes enough context to stand alone so it makes sense when retrieved individually. This granular approach enables precise retrieval - the system can pull exactly the relevant notes for a query without dragging in unrelated information.

The test-driven development approach validated the RAG system incrementally before scaling. Starting with 20 notes (10 general background, 10 WhatNow deep-dive), I tested retrieval precision and answer quality. WhatNow-focused queries retrieved 4.67/5 WhatNow notes showing excellent precision. General queries retrieved only 0.50/5 project-specific notes showing good separation. Expanding to 31 notes by adding 10 moh-ami notes validated multi-project behavior - "Tell me about moh-ami" retrieved 5/5 moh-ami notes with zero WhatNow contamination, proving semantic search alone distinguishes projects without metadata filtering.

The local storage decision came from pragmatic analysis of actual requirements. Initially I planned to use Pinecone for vector storage because that's what RAG tutorials recommend. But for datasets under 1000 notes, local JSON storage with NumPy similarity search is faster (no network latency), simpler (no external service), cheaper (completely free), and more than adequate for performance (<20ms query time). This demonstrates ability to question conventional wisdom and choose appropriate solutions for actual scale rather than assuming enterprise tools for small-scale problems.

The embeddings themselves are fascinating pieces of technology. They convert text into 1536-dimensional numerical vectors where semantically similar text has vectors that point in similar directions in this high-dimensional space. This enables searching by meaning rather than keyword matching. A query about "leadership" retrieves notes mentioning "team dad" approach even though "leadership" doesn't appear in those notes - the embedding understands they're semantically related concepts. This semantic understanding is what makes the RAG system feel intelligent.

The first-person voice in answers is carefully maintained through the atomic notes and LLM prompt design. Notes are written as if I'm speaking directly, using "I" and describing experiences personally. The LLM system prompt instructs it to answer in first person as if it is me. This creates answers that feel authentic and personal rather than clinical third-person descriptions. The goal is making the chatbot feel like talking to me, not reading about me.

The iteration story demonstrates mature engineering practices. Rather than building 200 notes before testing anything, I built 20 notes and validated the approach. The tests revealed the system worked excellently. Adding 10 more notes confirmed multi-project separation worked. This incremental validation ensures effort isn't wasted building on flawed foundations. Each iteration provided data informing the next decisions. This test-driven approach to AI system development is exactly the discipline that distinguishes production systems from prototypes.

The cost optimization throughout Folio reflects practical engineering thinking. Using GPT-4o-mini instead of GPT-4 saves 30x on generation costs. Local storage eliminates Pinecone fees. Semantic chunking reduces total tokens versus word-by-word approaches. The text-embedding-3-small model is cost-effective for embedding generation. For 84 notes, total embedding cost is approximately $0.08 - essentially free. Runtime costs for answering questions are under $0.01 per query. This cost-consciousness makes the system sustainable for personal projects while demonstrating awareness of production cost implications.

The multi-project retrieval capability was key to validate. With notes covering WhatNow, moh-ami, Atlantis, Nexus, Integrations, Cirrus, Portfolio Website, and background, the system must correctly distinguish which notes are relevant for which queries. The testing proved it does - project-specific queries retrieve 4-5 relevant notes for that project, cross-project queries appropriately pull from multiple projects, and general queries avoid over-representing any single project. This precision is what makes the answers useful rather than jumbled mixes of unrelated information.

The frontend design creates an engaging chat experience with initial suggestions showing example questions, message streaming creating typing feel, follow-up suggestions adapting to conversation, smooth animations and transitions, and responsive design working across devices. The interface feels modern and interactive, encouraging exploration through conversation rather than intimidating users with blank input boxes.

From a technical portfolio perspective, Folio itself is a portfolio piece. It demonstrates modern AI/ML techniques including RAG system architecture, semantic embeddings, vector similarity search, LLM prompt engineering, and production AI system design. It shows full-stack development with React/TypeScript frontend and FastAPI backend. It proves understanding of scalability through pragmatic architecture decisions. It exhibits test-driven development and iterative validation methodologies. Most importantly, it's a working deployed system that employers can actually use to learn about me.

The meta aspect of using an AI chatbot to present an AI/ML portfolio is deliberate. Folio doesn't just claim I can build AI systems - it proves it by being an AI system. The transparency of the implementation with comprehensive documentation, test results, and technical decisions documented provides evidence of real engineering work. Employers interested in AI/ML capabilities can examine Folio's architecture and understand exactly how modern RAG systems work in practice.

What makes Folio particularly valuable is solving a real problem I personally experienced. Traditional portfolios don't support the conversational evaluation process employers want. Folio fixes this by making portfolio information conversationally accessible through natural language questions. This demonstrates I don't just build technology for technology's sake - I identify genuine problems and build appropriate solutions.

The project timeline from January 2026 shows rapid development enabled by clear architecture decisions and focused scope. The comprehensive chat records document every technical decision from RAG system design through atomic notes philosophy to local storage decision. This transparency about the development process makes Folio not just a finished product but an educational resource showing how modern AI applications get built.

Folio represents the synthesis of everything I've learned about AI/ML, full-stack development, system architecture, and user experience design into a cohesive production-ready application that directly serves my job search while demonstrating the exact skills employers in AI/ML roles are looking for.
