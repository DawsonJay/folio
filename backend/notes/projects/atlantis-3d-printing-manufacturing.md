# Atlantis: 3D Printing and Self-Manufacturing Strategy

The 3D printing and self-manufacturing capability in Atlantis represents a strategic shift from dependency on external fabrication to complete control over the iterative design and production process. This demonstrates understanding of modern rapid prototyping and the value of owning the full development pipeline.

The acquisition of a Creality Ender 3 V3 SE 3D printer in September 2025 fundamentally changed the project trajectory. Originally I planned to design components in CAD software and send them to external printing services. This created dependencies, delayed iterations, and limited experimentation. Having my own printer means I can design something in the morning, print it in the afternoon, test it that evening, and iterate the next day. This rapid iteration cycle accelerates development dramatically.

The Creality Ender 3 V3 SE is an FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) printer with a 220x220x250mm build volume. This is large enough for controller enclosures, probe housings, and boat components but requires modular design for anything bigger. The CR Touch auto-leveling eliminates tedious manual bed leveling, making the printer beginner-friendly. The Sprite direct extruder provides reliable feeding of filament. The dual Z-axis design ensures level vertical motion. Automatic filament loading simplifies material changes. These features reduce friction in learning 3D printing while building Atlantis.

The material selection started with ELEGOO PLA+ filament in multiple colors: black for electronics enclosures, sea green for underwater components providing visibility in murky water, and translucent for experimental pieces and visual inspection of internal features. PLA+ is easier to print than regular PLA with better strength and less warping. It's perfect for learning the printer and developing initial designs. The plan includes progressing to PETG for better temperature and moisture resistance in actual deployed components, and eventually TPU for flexible gaskets and seals.

The controller enclosure design uses the printer's full capabilities. The modular snap-fit approach where top and bottom halves clip together without screws demonstrates understanding of design-for-manufacturing principles specific to 3D printing. Snap fits need proper clearances and draft angles to work reliably. Internal mounting posts for the circuit board must account for printing orientation and support material. The holes for buttons and joystick require precise dimensions for good fit. All these details come from learning 3D printing design principles and iterating on actual prints.

The probe housing presents unique challenges. The two-part sphere design with screw-on halves requires threads that print reliably. The O-ring grooves need precise dimensions for proper seal without crushing the O-ring. The sensor mounting positions must account for hemispherical coverage while fitting within the sphere. The cable pass-through needs proper sealing. These requirements push into advanced 3D printing techniques like printing threads, designing water-tight seals, and combining printed parts with gaskets.

The learning path for 3D printing followed logical progression. Start with calibration cubes to verify printer accuracy and tune settings. Print simple test pieces to understand how the printer behaves. Print the controller enclosure as the first real project with functional requirements. Use the experience to tackle more complex probe housing. Progress to PETG for better material properties. Eventually master TPU for gaskets. This incremental approach builds skills systematically.

The modular design philosophy accommodates the printer's build volume limitations. Rather than designing a single large component that doesn't fit, I design assemblies of smaller components that bolt together. The probe might be two hemispheres that screw together. The boat hull might be three sections that bolt with waterproof gaskets between sections. This modular approach also makes repairs easier - if one section damages, replace just that piece rather than reprinting the entire assembly.

The design-for-manufacturing considerations specific to FDM printing influenced every design decision. Minimize overhangs requiring support material because supports are wasteful and leave rough surfaces. Orient parts so critical dimensions print accurately - vertical dimensions can vary with layer height but horizontal dimensions depend on extrusion accuracy. Account for shrinkage and warping, especially with materials like ABS. Include draft angles on vertical walls for easier part removal. Add fillets and chamfers to strengthen corners. These principles come from understanding how FDM printing actually works.

The iteration speed advantage cannot be overstated. With external printing, a design iteration might take a week - submit design, wait for quote, approve cost, wait for printing, wait for shipping. With local printing, iterations take hours. Find a fit problem at 2pm, redesign it by 3pm, start printing at 3:30pm, have the revised part by 7pm, test it that evening. This 100x speed improvement transforms how you approach design. You can afford to experiment because iterations are essentially free.

The self-sufficiency aspect aligns with the project philosophy. Having complete control over manufacturing means no external dependencies that could derail the project. If COVID lockdowns happen or shipping delays occur or print services close, the project continues. This resilience and independence matter for ambitious personal projects where you can't simply throw money at problems.

The cost analysis favors ownership for any significant project. The printer cost $400 and filament about $25 per kilogram. Professional printing services charge $30-$100 per print depending on size and material. After 5-10 prints, the printer pays for itself. For Atlantis with dozens of test iterations and multiple final components, ownership is dramatically cheaper than external printing.

From a skills perspective, learning 3D printing and CAD design expands my capabilities into mechanical engineering and industrial design. I can design enclosures, brackets, mounts, fixtures, tools, and prototypes for any project going forward. This makes me more self-sufficient as an engineer and enables working on hardware projects that would otherwise require expensive machine shops or custom fabrication services.

The integration of 3D printing with the rest of the project demonstrates systems thinking. The printer enables manufacturing the controller enclosure. The controller enables operating the boat. The boat enables deploying the probe. The probe enables the mapping. Every piece depends on others, and the 3D printer is a key enabler of several pieces. Understanding these dependencies and designing the whole system holistically shows mature engineering thinking.

From a portfolio perspective, the 3D printing capability demonstrates I can work in physical product development, not just pure software. I understand CAD design, rapid prototyping, design-for-manufacturing, and iterative hardware development. Combined with the electronics and software work, this creates a complete picture of a maker who can bring ideas from concept through design to physical reality.

What I learned from acquiring 3D printing capability is that owning tools changes what you attempt. Before the printer, I designed conservatively because iterations were expensive. With the printer, I experiment freely because iterations are cheap. This psychological shift from scarcity to abundance in iteration budget fundamentally changes how you approach design problems. You try more ideas, accept more failures, and ultimately arrive at better solutions.

The 3D printing strategy in Atlantis - acquiring capability rather than buying services, starting with forgiving materials and progressing to advanced ones, designing for the specific capabilities and limitations of FDM printing, using iteration speed as a competitive advantage, integrating manufacturing with the overall system design - represents modern hardware development methodology. This is how products get developed in 2025: rapid CAD-to-prototype cycles, test-driven physical design, and owned rather than outsourced manufacturing for critical development work.

The Creality Ender 3 V3 SE sitting on my desk represents more than just a tool for Atlantis. It's a capability that enables an entire class of projects involving physical products. Every future project can now incorporate custom enclosures, mechanical components, and integrated hardware-software systems. This permanent expansion of my engineering toolkit makes me a more versatile and valuable engineer for any role involving IoT, robotics, or product development.
