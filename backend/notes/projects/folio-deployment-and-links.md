# Folio: Deployment Status, Tech Stack, and Project Links

Folio is currently in active development with substantial progress toward a complete AI-powered portfolio chatbot. While frontend integration with the RAG backend is pending, the core RAG system is fully implemented, tested, and validated across multiple iterations with excellent performance results.

**Project Status:** Backend RAG system complete and tested (January 2026). Frontend UI complete and functional with mock backend. Integration and production deployment pending.

**Source Code:** Will be published to GitHub when complete. The repository will include comprehensive backend implementation with FastAPI, RAG system with OpenAI integration, local embedding storage with NumPy similarity, atomic notes knowledge base, and test framework with results documentation. Frontend React/TypeScript implementation with chat interface, event-driven architecture, styled components, and responsive design. Complete documentation including system architecture, atomic notes guides, technical specifications, test results, and deployment instructions.

The technical stack demonstrates modern full-stack development practices with cutting-edge AI integration. The backend uses FastAPI for Python web framework providing fast async API endpoints, OpenAI for LLM services including text-embedding-3-small for embeddings and GPT-4o-mini for chat generation, NumPy for efficient vector similarity calculations, local JSON storage for embeddings and metadata, and Pydantic for request/response validation. The frontend uses React for component-based UI, TypeScript for type safety across the codebase, Vite for fast development and optimized builds, and Tailwind CSS for utility-first responsive styling.

The RAG system architecture implemented represents modern best practices. Atomic notes as knowledge base with 200-500 token focused self-contained entries written in first person natural language. OpenAI text-embedding-3-small generates 1536-dimensional semantic embeddings. Local JSON file stores embeddings with metadata for fast in-memory search. NumPy cosine similarity finds 5 most relevant notes for each query in under 20ms. LangChain orchestrates the RAG workflow. OpenAI GPT-4o-mini synthesizes retrieved notes into conversational answers. System prompt maintains authentic first-person voice throughout responses.

The testing framework validates system performance quantitatively. The test_retrieval.py script runs 17 predefined queries spanning WhatNow-focused, general background, and edge case categories. For each query, the script generates query embedding, searches for 5 most similar notes, records which notes were retrieved, generates LLM answer, counts project-specific notes in results, and calculates precision metrics. The output includes retrieval results for each query, generated answers for quality assessment, statistical analysis of precision and separation, and overall system performance assessment.

The test results across iterations demonstrate excellent performance. Iteration 1 with 21 notes achieved 4.67/5 WhatNow precision, 0.50/5 general separation, sub-20ms query time, and good answer quality. Iteration 2 with 31 notes achieved 4.50/5 WhatNow precision (stable), 5.00/5 moh-ami precision (perfect project separation), 0.50/5 general separation (unchanged), sub-20ms query time (no degradation), and maintained good answer quality. These results validate the RAG architecture works excellently and scales gracefully.

The documentation completeness provides comprehensive transparency. IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md tracks all development phases and outcomes. TEST-RESULTS.md and TEST-RESULTS-ITERATION-2.md document testing methodology and quantitative results. ATOMIC-NOTES-GUIDE.md provides practical guidance for writing effective notes. ATOMIC-NOTES-TECHNICAL.md explains embeddings and RAG technical foundations. NOTES-EXPANSION-PLAN.md organizes future note creation systematically. CHAT-RECORDS.md instructs on creating project records. The chatbot-portfolio-project-notes.md file contains comprehensive design notes covering RAG architecture, conversation context management, atomic notes approach, rate limiting, features, and implementation phases.

The project timeline captures rapid development through focused iteration. January 22-23, 2026 involved frontend prototype development with chat interface, suggestions system, and styled components. January 24-25, 2026 covered backend architecture planning including RAG system design, atomic notes philosophy, and local storage decision. January 26-28, 2026 focused on RAG implementation including OpenAI integration, embedding storage, and test framework. January 28-29, 2026 concentrated on note creation and testing with 20-note initial test, 31-note multi-project validation, and comprehensive test analysis. Ongoing work includes expanding to 84+ notes covering all portfolio projects and production deployment with frontend-backend integration.

The cost analysis demonstrates economic viability. Embedding generation for 84 notes costs approximately $0.08 total using text-embedding-3-small at $0.02 per million tokens. Chat generation per query costs under $0.01 using GPT-4o-mini at $0.15 per million input tokens. Local storage has zero operational cost versus $70+/month for vector database services. Total monthly cost for reasonable query volume (100 queries) is under $1. This cost-effectiveness makes Folio sustainable as a personal project while demonstrating understanding of production AI cost management.

The scalability projections based on iteration data forecast future performance. At 84 notes (current expanded target), expected query time 20-25ms with linear storage growth to approximately 4MB. At 100 notes, projected 25-30ms query time suitable for interactive use. At 200 notes, projected 30-40ms still excellent performance. At 500 notes, projected 40-50ms approaching optimization consideration threshold. At 1000 notes, projected 70-90ms where vector database migration becomes worthwhile for maintaining sub-50ms queries. These projections provide data-driven understanding of system scale limits.

The integration roadmap outlines remaining work to production deployment. Backend integration includes replacing mock chat endpoint with real RAG processing, implementing proper error handling and validation, adding request logging for analytics, and deploying to cloud platform (Railway or Render). Frontend integration involves connecting to real backend API, implementing proper loading and error states, adding conversation history management, and refining UI based on real usage. Production deployment requires environment configuration, monitoring and alerting setup, performance optimization if needed, and comprehensive documentation for maintenance.

The future enhancement possibilities extend Folio's capabilities beyond initial scope. Conversation memory enables multi-turn dialogue tracking context across questions. Source attribution shows which notes informed each answer for transparency. Follow-up question generation uses LLM to suggest relevant questions based on conversation. Analytics dashboard tracks which topics get asked most frequently to inform note priorities. Note revision system allows updating knowledge base as projects evolve. Multi-language support leverages embeddings' cross-lingual capabilities. These enhancements are feasible extensions proving the architecture accommodates growth.

The project philosophy emphasizes building useful tools that solve real problems rather than toy projects showcasing technologies. Folio addresses the genuine friction between static portfolios and conversational evaluation processes. The test-driven approach ensures it actually works before claiming success. The comprehensive documentation proves the work is real and substantial. The pragmatic technology choices optimize for actual requirements rather than following trends. This philosophy of purposeful engineering distinguishes Folio from resume padding projects.

From an employer perspective, Folio demonstrates numerous valuable capabilities. Modern AI/ML implementation with RAG systems. Semantic search and vector embeddings expertise. LLM integration and prompt engineering. Full-stack development with Python backend and React frontend. Test-driven development methodology. Pragmatic technology selection balancing sophistication with appropriateness. Clear technical communication through documentation. Understanding of AI cost optimization and scalability. These capabilities directly apply to AI/ML engineering roles and prove I can build production-ready AI applications.

The meta value of presenting an AI portfolio through an AI chatbot creates powerful demonstration of AI capabilities. Folio doesn't just claim I can build AI systems - it proves it by being an AI system that works. Employers can use it themselves, examine the source code, read the technical documentation, and understand the implementation depth. This transparency and verifiability make Folio uniquely convincing as demonstration of AI/ML expertise compared to describing projects in static text.

Folio represents the synthesis of everything I've learned about AI/ML development, full-stack engineering, system architecture, and user experience design into a cohesive production-ready application that directly serves my job search while demonstrating exactly the skills AI/ML roles require. The project succeeds as both functional software solving a real problem and portfolio demonstration proving I can build modern AI applications with professional engineering discipline.
