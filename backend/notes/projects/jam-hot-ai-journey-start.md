# Jam Hot: Starting the AI Journey and Early Exploration

Jam Hot represents the beginning of my AI journey and early exploration into machine learning and recommendation systems. Despite the project's failure, it marked the important first step from pure web development into AI/ML work that would eventually lead to successful projects like WhatNow, moh-ami, and Folio.

The motivation to explore AI came from recognizing AI/ML was becoming increasingly important in software development. Many interesting problems require AI techniques. Career growth into senior roles often involves AI understanding. The decision to start learning AI through a personal project rather than just tutorials or courses reflected learning style preference for hands-on experimentation.

The recommendation system focus seemed like accessible AI entry point. Recommendation systems are familiar from daily life - Netflix suggests movies, Spotify suggests music, Amazon suggests products. The perceived familiarity made recommendation systems feel approachable for first AI project. This perception proved partially wrong as recommendation systems are more complex than they appear, but the reasoning made sense initially.

The learning process introduced fundamental AI concepts. Understanding collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approaches. Learning about feature engineering and representation learning. Exploring evaluation metrics like precision/recall. Reading research papers about recommendation algorithms. This foundation knowledge has proven valuable despite project failure.

The technical experimentation explored various approaches before settling on direction. Tried different algorithms. Experimented with feature representations. Tested different data structures. This exploration phase taught practical details about AI development workflow that tutorials don't convey - the iterative experimentation and evaluation cycle central to ML development.

The failure timing was actually fortunate. Failing early before massive time investment prevented the sunk cost fallacy trap. If the project had progressed further before failing, the psychological investment might have made stopping harder. Early failure enabled quick pivot to better-scoped projects applying lessons learned.

The confidence development from initial AI exploration made later projects less intimidating. WhatNow didn't feel as scary because Jam Hot had already introduced core concepts. The familiarity with AI terminology, algorithms, and workflows from Jam Hot provided foundation making WhatNow implementation smoother. First projects are always hardest even if they fail.

The AI journey narrative positions Jam Hot as important beginning despite failure. The story "started with Jam Hot which failed teaching valuable lessons, then succeeded with WhatNow applying those lessons" creates compelling growth narrative. This shows learning trajectory more interesting than claiming instant success without setbacks or iteration.

The persistence through failure demonstrates resilience valuable to employers. Many developers try AI, fail on first project, and give up concluding AI isn't for them. Continuing after Jam Hot failure showed determination and ability to learn from setbacks. This psychological resilience distinguishes developers who eventually master new domains from those who retreat to comfort zones.
