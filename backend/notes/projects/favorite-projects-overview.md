# My Favorite Projects: What Makes Them Special

When people ask about my favorite projects, I find it interesting to think across different categories - completed work, ongoing ambitions, valuable failures, and professional contributions. Each reveals something different about what drives me as a developer.

## Favorite Completed Personal Project: moh-ami

My favorite completed personal project is moh-ami, a French learning translation tool I built for a friend to help her learn French. What makes this project special to me is the direct personal connection - I was solving a real problem for someone I care about, which gave the work genuine meaning beyond just building something for my portfolio.

moh-ami is an excellent example of leveraging AI to solve real-world problems. The system provides not just translations, but word-by-word mappings, grammar explanations, cultural context, and alternative translations. It's deployed and actually being used, which is incredibly satisfying.

The most challenging and rewarding aspect was crafting the LLM prompt. Getting the model to consistently produce the structured output I needed - synchronized translations, grammatical insights, cultural nuances - required iteration and precision. This is an area where I have significant skill and experience, and moh-ami really showcases that ability to engineer effective prompts that extract exactly what you need from language models.

## Favorite Ongoing Project: Atlantis

My favorite ongoing project is Atlantis, the lake bed mapping system. This project ties directly to my core passions: AI, robotics, and exploration. The idea of building a system that can explore and map places that are otherwise inaccessible - underwater environments that would be dangerous or impossible to reach - captures my imagination completely.

What I love most about Atlantis is that it's wildly ambitious. I'm not building a simple proof of concept or following a tutorial. I'm engineering a complete system with GPS positioning, ultrasonic sensors, LoRa communication with DNA-style error correction, and sophisticated mapping algorithms. The scope could easily feel overwhelming, but instead it energizes me.

The learning journey has been incredible. I've gained deep experience with embedded systems programming, hardware integration, sensor fusion, RF communication protocols, and mechanical design. Each technical challenge I solve teaches me something new about systems thinking, failure modes, and practical engineering. Even though Atlantis isn't deployed yet, the pursuit of this ambitious goal has made me a significantly better engineer.

## Favorite Failed Project: Cirrus

My favorite failed project is Cirrus, the weather prediction system. While the project was ultimately cancelled, it contains so many clever solutions for handling massive datasets and AI implementation that I learned enormously from the attempt.

The technical challenges were substantial: processing 56 million weather records, implementing sophisticated spatial interpolation algorithms, and dealing with data that had critical gaps. My approach involved prioritizing which data was essential, breaking the land into grid cells, and interpolating missing values to create something the AI could train on. I built dual-tier interpolation systems, KD-tree spatial indexing, and genetic algorithms for model evolution.

Ultimately, the project failed because the underlying weather data had fundamental quality issues - no amount of clever algorithms could compensate for data that simply didn't exist. But Cirrus was a "failure forward." I gained invaluable experience in data engineering, spatial algorithms, and most importantly, I learned to recognize when a project's foundational assumptions are flawed. That lesson about knowing when to pivot or stop has informed every project since. The technical depth I developed is real and transferable, even though Cirrus never achieved its goals.

## Favorite Work Project: Nexus Dashboard

My favorite work project is the Nexus Dashboard at Nurtur. What makes this special is the complete ownership and creative freedom I have. I own the entire frontend - everything from the design to the code is mine. I built it from nothing, and that level of autonomy is both challenging and deeply satisfying.

Nexus is built to help internal teams visualize and manage the Job Manager system. What I love most is being able to talk directly to the end users - my colleagues who will use this tool every day - and tailor it exactly to their needs. That direct feedback loop, where I can understand their workflows, anticipate their pain points, and craft solutions that genuinely make their work easier, is incredibly rewarding.

The technical architecture uses foundation block components for scalability and maintainability. I'm implementing safety layers and focusing heavily on developer experience, knowing that this system needs to serve the team for years. The ongoing nature of the project means I'm continuously refining and improving based on real usage, which keeps the work engaging and meaningful.

## What These Favorites Reveal

Looking across these favorites, I see a pattern: I care deeply about building things that matter. Whether it's helping a friend learn French, exploring inaccessible places, learning from ambitious failures, or supporting my colleagues' daily work, the projects I'm most passionate about are the ones with genuine purpose and human connection. The technical challenges excite me, but what really drives me is creating systems that provide real value to real people.
