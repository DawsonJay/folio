# Atlantis: Project Status, Deployment Plans, and Documentation

Atlantis is currently in active development with substantial progress toward a complete lake bed mapping system. While not yet deployed for actual lake mapping, the project has comprehensive documentation, tested components, and clear roadmap to completion. The journey from concept through pivot to current architecture is fully documented across 63 chat records spanning September through December 2025.

The GitHub repository contains complete project documentation including PROJECT-STATUS.md tracking all completed milestones and pending work, README.md explaining the system architecture and philosophy, DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md capturing the chronological development journey, comprehensive sensor testing scripts for MPU6050, BMP280, QMC5883L, and HC-SR04, UART communication libraries for Pi-to-Pico coordination, hardware assembly guides and pinout documentation, troubleshooting guides for recurring issues, and component research and selection documentation.

The project documentation demonstrates professional development practices rarely seen in personal projects. Every component purchase is photographed and catalogued. Every sensor is individually tested with results documented. Every technical decision is recorded with rationale explained. Every failed experiment is written up with lessons learned. This creates a comprehensive knowledge base that proves the authenticity and depth of the work while serving as valuable reference for future development.

The current project status reflects the major strategic pivot from underwater drone to surface boat plus probe mapping system completed in October 2025. The pivot decision is fully documented with analysis of why the underwater approach had fundamental challenges and how the new architecture solves them more elegantly. This transparency about changing direction demonstrates engineering maturity and honest assessment of approaches.

The component inventory includes substantial hardware investment representing commitment to the project. The Raspberry Pi 3B (discovered to be 3B not 4B, leading to strategic adaptation) serves as main processor. The Raspberry Pi Pico handles real-time sensor control. Four brushless motors with ESCs provide propulsion potentially for boat or winch. A 6000mAh LiPo battery with BMS provides power. The power distribution board with integrated voltage regulators distributes power to subsystems. Multiple sensor types include MPU6050 IMU, BMP280 pressure sensors, QMC5883L compass, and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors. The Creality Ender 3 V3 SE 3D printer with ELEGOO PLA+ filament enables self-manufacturing of enclosures and components. Two Ai-Thinker RA-02 SX1278 LoRa modules at 433 MHz enable long-range communication.

The technical milestones achieved include complete Stage 1 sensor integration with all four sensor types validated and tested, UART communication system working with sub-25ms response time and 100% success rate, comprehensive troubleshooting documentation for hardware issues, Stage 2 propulsion components procured and validated for compatibility, 3D printing equipment acquired and ready for enclosure manufacturing, LoRa communication modules selected and procured, DNA-style error correction protocol designed, and strategic pivot analysis and new architecture designed.

The pending development work follows clear phases. Phase 1 focuses on controller design with 3D printed enclosure, Arduino Nano integration, e-paper display implementation, joystick and button wiring, and LoRa communication setup. Phase 2 covers surface boat design including GPS module integration, motor control system, winch mechanism design, boat hull 3D modeling, and power distribution. Phase 3 involves probe design with eight ultrasonic sensor array, hemispherical housing design, accelerometer for cable angle, waterproof enclosure with O-ring seals, and cable-based data transmission. Phase 4 develops mapping software with 3D point cloud generation, GPS coordinate processing, depth calculation from cable geometry, data visualization, and post-processing algorithms. Phase 5 completes system integration and testing with full system assembly, lake testing and calibration, reliability validation, and real-world mapping demonstration.

The timeline projections are realistic based on part-time weekend development. Controller development in Q1 2026 includes enclosure design, 3D printing iterations, electronics assembly, and LoRa testing. Boat development in Q2 2026 covers hull design, motor and winch integration, GPS testing, and power system validation. Probe development in Q2-Q3 2026 involves sensor array assembly, housing design and printing, waterproofing testing, and cable system implementation. Software development throughout 2026 includes mapping algorithms, data processing, visualization tools, and user interface refinement. Full system testing in late 2026 includes lake deployments, accuracy validation, reliability testing, and performance optimization.

The target deployment environments are reservoirs and lakes in the Peak District of England initially, with depths of 35-41 meters typical. Later expansion could include deeper reservoirs, rivers with slower current, coastal harbors and bays, and potentially commercial applications for environmental monitoring or underwater structure surveys. The system is specifically designed for these environments with appropriate depth ratings, communication range, and operational procedures.

The engineering methodology demonstrates professional practices including comprehensive documentation of all work, systematic component testing before integration, modular design enabling independent development of subsystems, safety-first approach with multiple failsafe mechanisms, cost-conscious development within defined budget, iterative refinement based on testing and experience, and transparent recording of both successes and failures. This methodology makes the project valuable for portfolio purposes beyond just the technical achievements.

From a portfolio perspective, Atlantis demonstrates hardware integration skills beyond typical web development, embedded systems programming in Python and C++, sensor fusion and data processing, RF communication and wireless protocols, mechanical design and 3D printing, project management and strategic planning, and ability to recognize when to pivot and adapt approaches. The project's breadth shows I can work across the full stack from silicon to software to physical product design.

The documentation completeness is a key portfolio value. The 63 chat records capturing September through December 2025 development provide extraordinary transparency about the actual development process. Employers can read these records and understand exactly what work happened, what challenges arose, how I solved them, and what I learned. This level of documentation is rare and demonstrates professional development practices that translate directly to workplace engineering.

The project name "Atlantis" and system name "The Momo" (after Captain Momo from the graphic novel "Captain Momo's Secret Base") establish identity that balances professionalism with personality. The hostname "momo" for the Raspberry Pi creates continuity with this naming. The understated identity will build legend through achievements rather than flashy branding, reflecting the engineering philosophy of substance over style.

The budget evolution from $500 CAD target to approximately $1,300 CAD actual demonstrates realistic cost management. Initial estimates proved optimistic once requirements became fully clear. Rather than abandoning the project when costs increased, I justified additional investment based on capabilities gained: blind exploration equipment adding $200-$400, 3D printing capability adding $400, LoRa communication components, and iterative component purchases as learning revealed needs. This realistic budget tracking shows honest project management rather than wishful thinking.

The future vision includes completing Atlantis as a functional mapping system, deploying it for actual lake surveys and documenting results, potentially developing it into a product others could build following my designs, contributing to environmental monitoring and underwater archaeology communities, and using Atlantis as foundation for future robotics and autonomous systems projects. The project has value beyond personal achievement as potentially useful technology for hobbyists and researchers.

Atlantis represents engineering for impossible places - creating tools to access environments requiring genuine skill to reach. The combination of hardware, software, mechanical design, and systems thinking makes it a compelling portfolio piece that demonstrates abilities far beyond typical software development projects. The comprehensive documentation proves the work is real and substantial, not just talk.
