# Atlantis: Controller Design and User Interface

The controller for Atlantis represents the human interface to the lake mapping system, designed as a phone-sized handheld unit with an e-paper display, joystick, buttons, and long-range LoRa communication. This is where all the complex hardware and software manifests as intuitive controls for operating the boat and probe.

The form factor deliberately mimics a smartphone for familiar ergonomics. Phone-sized fits comfortably in one hand leaving the other free for taking photos or handling a notebook. The rectangular shape with rounded edges feels natural to grip. The weight distribution with battery and LoRa module inside provides solid heft that doesn't feel toy-like. This attention to ergonomics matters because mapping sessions might last hours and the controller needs to remain comfortable throughout.

The e-paper display provides the user interface and feedback. E-paper uses no power to maintain an image, only to change it, giving extraordinary battery life. The high contrast remains readable in direct sunlight where LCD screens wash out. The slow refresh rate is perfect for status displays that update every few seconds rather than video-rate content. I can show GPS coordinates, boat battery level, probe depth, winch status, signal strength, and mode indicators all at once without draining the controller battery.

The joystick provides boat navigation control. Forward and backward for propulsion, left and right for steering. The analog joystick gives proportional control rather than just on/off, allowing gentle maneuvering for precise positioning during mapping. The joystick centers with a spring return so releasing it stops boat movement, providing intuitive default-to-safe behavior. This tactile feedback makes operating the boat feel natural even without looking at the controller.

The buttons handle discrete actions requiring deliberate activation. One button for winch up, another for winch down, allowing independent depth control. A mode button switches between navigation mode and mapping mode. An emergency stop button kills all boat motors and locks the winch. Buttons have positive tactile feedback with clear click feel so you know when you've pressed them even with gloves or without looking directly at the controller.

The LoRa module inside the controller uses 433 MHz for 5-20 kilometer range communication with the boat. The high-gain antenna extends above the controller housing for optimal RF performance. The SX1278 chipset connects via SPI to the Arduino Nano microcontroller that manages all the controller hardware. The DNA-style error correction protocol ensures commands reach the boat reliably even in challenging RF environments with interference or obstructions.

The controller architecture uses an Arduino Nano for microcontroller duties. The Nano reads the joystick analog inputs, monitors button states, drives the e-paper display via SPI, and communicates through the LoRa module. This keeps the controller simple and power-efficient - no Raspberry Pi or complex operating system, just straightforward embedded code running directly on the hardware. The entire controller can run for hours or days on a small battery pack.

The 3D printed enclosure uses a modular snap-fit design where the top and bottom halves clip together without screws. This allows easy assembly and disassembly for maintenance, battery replacement, or electronics access. The Creality Ender 3 V3 SE 3D printer's 220x220x250mm build volume accommodates the controller as a single print for the back and another for the front, avoiding the need to join multiple pieces. Internal mounting posts position the circuit board and hold the display in place.

The design includes practical details like a lanyard attachment point so the controller can hang around your neck during boat launches or retrievals when you need both hands free. The waterproof design uses gaskets around the joystick shaft and buttons where they penetrate the enclosure, protecting electronics from splashes though not full submersion. The e-paper display sits behind a clear window rather than being exposed, preventing scratches.

Power management is critical for a portable controller. The Arduino Nano runs on 5V from a USB power bank or small LiPo battery pack. The e-paper display needs 3.3V which is provided by the Nano's onboard regulator. The LoRa module also runs on 3.3V. The joystick and buttons are purely analog/digital inputs requiring no power. With careful power management and the ultra-low power consumption of e-paper, the controller can operate for many hours between charges.

The user interface design philosophy is show critical information at a glance and make common actions quick. The display shows GPS coordinates prominently so you know where the boat is. Battery level and signal strength have dedicated areas so you can tell at a glance if something needs attention. Mode indicator shows whether you're navigating or mapping. Depth gauge shows current probe depth. This information hierarchy puts safety and operational awareness first.

The command protocol between controller and boat uses structured packets over LoRa. Each joystick movement sends updated thrust and steering values. Button presses send discrete commands for winch control or mode changes. The boat acknowledges commands and sends back status updates including GPS position, battery voltage, and sensor readings. The DNA-style error correction ensures commands aren't lost or corrupted even if many individual radio packets fail.

From a technical perspective, the controller demonstrates embedded systems design, user interface design for physical controls, RF communication integration, power management for portable devices, mechanical design and 3D printing, and human factors engineering for ergonomics. It shows I can design complete products combining electronics, software, and mechanical elements rather than just writing code.

What I learned from controller design is that physical products have different constraints than pure software. You have to think about how it feels in the hand, whether buttons are reachable, whether the display is readable, whether it's weatherproof enough. Software can be updated anytime but physical design requires getting it right before printing. This forces more upfront thinking and planning than iterative software development.

The controller development timeline spans late 2025 through early 2026. The LoRa module selection in December 2025 resolved component availability issues and established the 433 MHz frequency for the system. The enclosure design will use the 3D printer acquired in September 2025. The electronics integration builds on sensor work from earlier drone development. Each phase of the Atlantis project contributed lessons that inform the controller design.

The controller represents the user-facing tip of the entire Atlantis system. Everything else - the complex LoRa protocols, the sensor fusion, the GPS processing, the winch control, the mapping algorithms - all of it gets distilled down to a simple handheld device with a joystick and a few buttons. This abstraction of complexity into simplicity is the essence of good interface design and shows I understand that sophisticated engineering should make things simpler for users, not more complicated.

What makes the controller particularly interesting from a portfolio perspective is that it's a physical product design. Most of my work is software, but Atlantis pushes into industrial design, mechanical engineering, and user experience for physical devices. This breadth demonstrates I can think holistically about products as complete systems, not just code.
