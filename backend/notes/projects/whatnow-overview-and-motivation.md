# WhatNow: AI Activity Recommendation System

WhatNow is an AI-powered activity recommendation system that helps me decide what to do when I'm feeling stuck or unmotivated. It's a production-deployed application that I actually use in my daily life, which makes it particularly satisfying - it's not just a portfolio piece, it's a tool that provides real value.

The core concept is simple: I input my current context using sliders for mood, energy level, social preference, available time, and weather conditions. The AI then generates 50 personalized activity suggestions from a database of 1,249 activities with semantic embeddings. I pick my top 3 favorites, and if none are quite right, I can regenerate for more options while my favorites accumulate in a pool. Eventually I make a final selection from all the activities I've marked as favorites, and the AI learns from my choice to make better recommendations in future sessions.

What makes WhatNow special is that it's a complete end-to-end machine learning system in production, not just a model or proof of concept. It handles data acquisition through user interaction, implements continuous learning that improves over time, balances immediate responsiveness with long-term robustness, and provides genuine utility that keeps me engaged with it. The fact that I actually use it regularly means the AI is constantly training on real data from real usage.

The motivation for building WhatNow came from a very practical problem. I had tried building computer vision projects - a fruit recognition system called Jam Hot and a weather prediction system called Cirrus - and both failed because of fundamental dataset quality issues. The Fruit-360 dataset gave me 86% validation accuracy but 0% real-world accuracy when I tested it with actual photos. I realized that for personal portfolio projects, acquiring high-quality datasets is often the insurmountable barrier to completion.

WhatNow solves that problem by generating its own training data. Every time I use it, I'm providing labeled examples of what activities I prefer given specific contexts. The AI doesn't need a massive pre-existing dataset - it learns from my actual usage over time. This meant I could actually finish the project and deploy it, rather than getting stuck in the data acquisition phase indefinitely.

The personal utility aspect is important beyond just data generation. I genuinely find it helpful when I'm in that state of "I want to do something but I don't know what." Having an AI suggest activities based on my current mood and energy level often surfaces ideas I wouldn't have thought of myself. Sometimes I don't follow its suggestions exactly, but the act of seeing possibilities helps break through the initial stuck feeling.

From a portfolio perspective, WhatNow demonstrates several valuable skills. It shows I can build complete AI/ML systems from scratch, not just follow tutorials. It proves I understand reinforcement learning and contextual bandits. It demonstrates full-stack development with React, TypeScript, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. It shows I can deploy and maintain production systems on platforms like Render. Most importantly, it proves I can take projects all the way from concept to deployed, usable application.

The project has gone through multiple significant iterations - from manual metadata to AI embeddings, from vanilla JavaScript to professional React architecture, from Railway to Render for hosting, from scikit-learn to custom lightweight implementations. These pivots demonstrate adaptability and the ability to make pragmatic technical decisions based on changing constraints.

What I'm most proud of with WhatNow is that it's real. It's not a toy example or a tutorial project. It's a complete system that works, that I use, and that continuously improves through actual usage. That realness - building something that provides genuine value and works reliably in production - is exactly what I want to demonstrate to potential employers.
