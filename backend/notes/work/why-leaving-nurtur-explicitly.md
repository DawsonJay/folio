# Why I'm Leaving My Current Role

## Direct Answer

I'm not leaving because of problems with Nurtur - they've been excellent for my growth. I'm leaving because after 2+ years, I've achieved what this role can teach me and I'm ready for the next stage of my career progression.

## What I've Accomplished at Nurtur

In 2+ years, I've:
- ✅ Gone from junior developer to trusted contributor on critical systems
- ✅ Built production systems that last (Integrations Dashboard: 3+ years, zero maintenance)
- ✅ Developed mentoring capability (teaching backend devs frontend)
- ✅ Proven full-stack ability
- ✅ Mastered complex state management (Redux Toolkit)
- ✅ Worked on company's most critical infrastructure (Nexus Dashboard)

**I've maximized what this role can teach me.** To keep growing, I need different challenges.

## Why Now Is the Right Time

### 1. Technical Growth Ceiling
**Current role**: React/TypeScript frontend development for internal dashboards.

**What I need next**: More AI/ML focused work, deeper technical challenges, projects involving real-world systems (not just web interfaces).

**My trajectory**: Web dev → AI/ML → robotics → exploration technology. Nurtur doesn't have AI/robotics work, so staying means not progressing toward my goals.

### 2. Immigration to Canada
**Major life decision**: I'm pursuing permanent residence in Canada through Working Holiday Visa pathway.

**Why Canada**: Natural beauty, environmental values, work-life balance culture, innovation in technology. I want to build my life there.

**Timing**: After 2+ years of solid UK experience, now is the right time to make this international move.

### 3. Values Alignment
**Current work**: Internal business dashboards. Practical and valuable, but not aligned with my deeper values.

**What I want**: Projects that help people experience wonder and connect with the natural world. Technologies for exploration, environmental monitoring, or scientific discovery.

**Nurtur can't provide this** - they're a business software company. This isn't a criticism; it's a mismatch of long-term direction.

## What I'm NOT Leaving For

**Not leaving because**:
- ❌ Dissatisfaction with team or management (team is great)
- ❌ Conflict or problems (excellent working relationships)
- ❌ Better pay elsewhere (values matter more than money)
- ❌ Boredom or laziness (I'm pursuing harder challenges)
- ❌ Burnout (I'm energized to grow more)

**I'm leaving because I've succeeded here and need the next challenge.**

## How I'm Leaving

**Professionally and respectfully**:
- Giving proper notice
- Documenting my work thoroughly
- Helping transition my responsibilities
- Maintaining relationships (they're good people)

**No bitterness**: Nurtur gave me exactly what I needed at that stage. First professional role out of bootcamp, real production experience, mentoring opportunities, complex technical challenges.

**Gratitude**: They took a chance on a bootcamp graduate and gave me opportunities to prove myself. The Integrations Dashboard success, Nexus contributions, Email Editor work - all valuable experiences I'm grateful for.

## What I'm Looking For Next

**In Canada**:
- Small, motivated team (3-4 people) working on meaningful projects
- More AI/ML and systems work (not just web interfaces)
- Projects aligned with exploration or environmental technology
- Growth opportunity toward robotics/embedded systems
- Results-focused culture (not rigid processes)

**Career progression**:
- Apply my current skills (full-stack, AI/ML foundations, leadership)
- Grow toward my long-term goals (exploration technology)
- Work on projects I can believe in
- Continue learning and pushing to new heights

## The Simple Version

**Why leaving**: After 2+ years, I've accomplished what this role can teach me. To continue my deliberate progression toward AI/robotics and exploration technology, I need roles with different technical focus. Combined with immigration to Canada and seeking values-aligned work, now is the right time to move forward.

**Not a problem with Nurtur** - it's about my career trajectory requiring the next stage. I'm leaving successfully, not running from problems.
