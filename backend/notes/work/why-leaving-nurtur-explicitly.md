# Why I'm Leaving My Current Role

## Direct Answer

I'm being made redundant at Nurtur. While this wasn't my choice, it aligns with my career goals and provides an opportunity to pursue the next stage of my professional development.

## What I've Accomplished at Nurtur

In 3.5 years, I've:
- ✅ Gone from junior developer to trusted contributor on critical systems
- ✅ Built production systems that last (Integrations Dashboard: 3+ years, zero maintenance)
- ✅ Developed mentoring capability (teaching backend devs frontend)
- ✅ Proven full-stack ability
- ✅ Mastered complex state management (Redux Toolkit)
- ✅ Worked on company's most critical infrastructure (Nexus Dashboard)

**I've maximized what this role could teach me.** The redundancy provides an opportunity to pursue different challenges.

## Why Now Is the Right Time

### 1. Technical Growth Ceiling
**Current role**: React/TypeScript frontend development for internal dashboards.

**What I need next**: More AI/ML focused work, deeper technical challenges, projects involving real-world systems (not just web interfaces).

**My trajectory**: Web dev → AI/ML → robotics → exploration technology. Nurtur doesn't have AI/robotics work, so this transition allows me to progress toward my goals.

### 2. Immigration to Canada
**Major life decision**: I'm pursuing permanent residence in Canada through Working Holiday Visa pathway.

**Why Canada**: Natural beauty, environmental values, work-life balance culture, innovation in technology. I want to build my life there.

**Timing**: After 3.5 years of solid UK experience, this transition comes at the right time to make this international move.

### 3. Values Alignment
**Current work**: Internal business dashboards. Practical and valuable, but not aligned with my deeper values.

**What I want**: Projects that help people experience wonder and connect with the natural world. Technologies for exploration, environmental monitoring, or scientific discovery.

**Nurtur can't provide this** - they're a business software company. This isn't a criticism; it's a mismatch of long-term direction that this transition allows me to address.

## Gratitude for the Experience

**Nurtur gave me exactly what I needed at that stage**: First professional role out of bootcamp, real production experience, mentoring opportunities, complex technical challenges.

**No bitterness**: They took a chance on a bootcamp graduate and gave me opportunities to prove myself. The Integrations Dashboard success, Nexus contributions, Email Editor work - all valuable experiences I'm grateful for.

## How I'm Handling the Transition

**Professionally and respectfully**:
- Completing all responsibilities during notice period
- Documenting my work thoroughly
- Helping transition my responsibilities
- Maintaining relationships (they're good people)

**Focus on the future**: While the redundancy wasn't my choice, I'm viewing it as an opportunity to pursue work that better aligns with my career trajectory and values.

## What I'm Looking For Next

**In Canada**:
- Small, motivated team (3-4 people) working on meaningful projects
- More AI/ML and systems work (not just web interfaces)
- Projects aligned with exploration or environmental technology
- Growth opportunity toward robotics/embedded systems
- Results-focused culture (not rigid processes)

**Career progression**:
- Apply my current skills (full-stack, AI/ML foundations, leadership)
- Grow toward my long-term goals (exploration technology)
- Work on projects I can believe in
- Continue learning and pushing to new heights

## The Simple Version

**Why leaving**: I'm being made redundant at Nurtur. While this wasn't my choice, it aligns with my career trajectory toward AI/robotics and exploration technology. Combined with immigration to Canada and seeking values-aligned work, this transition provides the right opportunity to move forward.

**Gratitude for Nurtur** - they gave me valuable experience that prepared me for this next stage. I'm leaving with appreciation for what I learned and excitement for what's next.
