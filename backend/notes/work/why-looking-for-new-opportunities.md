# Why I'm Looking for New Opportunities

## Current Situation

I'm being made redundant at Nurtur. While this wasn't my choice, it aligns with my career goals and provides an opportunity to pursue the next stage of my professional development.

## Career Trajectory Goals

**Deliberate progression**: I'm building from web development → AI/ML → robotics → exploration technology. This isn't random - it's strategic.

**Current position**: Full Stack Developer with primary focus on React/TypeScript frontend, but with full-stack responsibilities including backend work, architecture decisions, and mentoring.

**Next needed step**: More AI/ML focused work, deeper technical challenges, projects that align with my values of wonder and connection.

**Long-term vision**: Working on exploration technology (deep sea/space) or environmental systems that help people understand and connect with the natural world.

## What I've Achieved at Nurtur (3.5 Years)

✅ Built production systems (Integrations Dashboard - 3+ years, zero maintenance)  
✅ Contributed to critical infrastructure (Nexus Dashboard, Email Editor)  
✅ Developed mentoring capability (teaching backend devs frontend)  
✅ Proven full-stack ability  
✅ Mastered Redux Toolkit and complex state management  
✅ Learned to work in established codebases at scale

**I've maximized what this role could teach me**. The redundancy provides an opportunity to pursue different challenges that align with my growth trajectory.

## Immigration to Canada

**Working Holiday Visa pathway**: Actively pursuing permanent residence in Canada.

**Why Canada**: Natural beauty, environmental values, work-life balance culture, innovation in technology. I want to build my life and career there.

**Timing**: This transition comes at the right time. I have 3.5 years of solid experience and proven production systems, making this an ideal moment to make the move to Canada.

**Commitment**: This isn't about "trying out" Canada. It's about choosing where I want to live long-term and finding work that grows with me there.

## Seeking Values Alignment

**Current work**: Internal dashboards for business operations. Practical and valuable, but not aligned with my deeper values.

**What I want**: Work on projects that help people experience wonder and connect with the natural world. Technologies that help humanity live with nature rather than consume it.

**Examples of interest**:
- Deep sea or space exploration
- Environmental monitoring systems
- Robotics for scientific discovery
- Technologies that build empathy with the natural world
- Tools that encourage understanding over consumption

**"I don't want to work for money alone"**: While Nurtur pays well, meaningful work that aligns with my values is more important for long-term satisfaction and sustainability.

## Technical Growth Needs

**Current skills**: Strong in React/TypeScript, Redux, frontend architecture, full-stack web development.

**Skills I'm building**: AI/ML (contextual bandits in WhatNow, LLM integration in moh-ami, RAG in Folio), embedded systems (Atlantis), hardware-software integration.

**What I need next**: Roles that let me apply current skills while growing into more AI/ML and systems work. Working with experienced engineers in robotics, exploration, or environmental tech.

**Learning style**: I learn best through meaningful projects, not abstract study. I need work that challenges me in directions I want to grow.

## Team and Culture Fit

**What worked at Nurtur**: Small team, professional respect, autonomy to structure my own work.

**What I'm seeking**: 3-4 person team, everyone extremely motivated and believes in the project, everyone has stake in success, decisions by consensus, results over process.

**Leadership opportunity**: Ready to take on more leadership while remaining technical contributor. My "team dad" style brings teams together and encourages everyone's best work.

## Gratitude for the Experience

**Nurtur was exactly what I needed at that stage**: I went from bootcamp graduate to confident production engineer. They gave me mentoring opportunities, let me build the Integrations Dashboard solo, trusted me with critical systems like Nexus.

**Why this transition works**: While the redundancy wasn't my choice, it aligns with my career goals. Nurtur doesn't have AI/robotics work. They don't focus on exploration or environmental technology. This transition allows me to pursue what I need for the next 5 years of growth.

**Handling the transition professionally**: I'm committed to a smooth transition, documenting my work thoroughly, and helping transition my responsibilities. I respect what they've given me and want to leave them in good shape.

## The Bottom Line

I'm looking because:
1. **Transition**: Being made redundant provides opportunity to pursue next career stage
2. **Geographic**: Moving to Canada for immigration and lifestyle
3. **Technical**: Need more AI/ML and systems work to continue growth trajectory
4. **Values**: Want projects that align with wonder, connection, and helping humanity relate to nature
5. **Timing**: 3.5 years experience is right time to make this move

I'm not running away from problems. I'm running toward my goals. The next role should use my current strengths (full-stack web dev, AI/ML foundations, leadership) while growing me toward robotics and exploration technology in a Canadian environment with meaningful work.
