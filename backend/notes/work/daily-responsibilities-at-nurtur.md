# Daily Responsibilities at Nurtur

## Role: Full Stack Developer

**Company**: Nurtur (operating as BriefYourMarket.com)  
**Duration**: July 2022 - February 2026 (3.5 years)  
**Location**: Derby, UK  
**Hours**: 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday to Friday (flexible in practice)

## Primary Responsibilities

### Frontend Development

**React/TypeScript development**: Building and maintaining user-facing features across multiple dashboards and tools.

**Component architecture**: Creating reusable, maintainable React components that scale across different dashboard types.

**State management**: Implementing Redux Toolkit for complex application state, particularly in Email Editor and Nexus Dashboard.

**Responsive design**: Ensuring interfaces work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

**Performance optimization**: Keeping applications fast and responsive, especially important for data-heavy dashboards.

## Major Projects

### Nexus Dashboard (Current Focus)

**Most critical company system**: The main internal dashboard used by multiple teams daily.

**My contributions**:
- Implementing foundation blocks architecture for scalability
- Building reusable dashboard components
- Focusing on developer experience (making it easy for teammates to build new features)
- Creating safety layers to prevent breaking changes
- Performance optimization for complex data visualizations

**Collaboration**: Working with backend team on API design, with designers on UX, with other frontend developers on component standards.

### Email Editor

**Team collaboration project**: Built alongside other developers.

**My specific contributions**:
- Implemented Redux Toolkit for editor state management
- Integrated Lexical framework for rich text editing
- Created link editor component
- Mentored backend developers transitioning to frontend work
- Helped deploy to production

**Challenge**: Complex state management (document content, selection, history, collaboration, UI state) required thoughtful architecture.

### Integrations Dashboard

**Solo full-stack project**: Built entirely by me to bridge backend and sales teams.

**Responsibility**:
- Gathered requirements from both technical (backend) and non-technical (sales) stakeholders
- Designed and implemented both frontend and backend
- Deployed to production
- Maintained initially, but it's been stable for 3+ years with zero ongoing maintenance

**Impact**: Increased sales team productivity significantly by making backend data accessible and intuitive.

## Daily Activities

**Standup/check-ins**: Coordinating with team on current tasks and blockers (typically 2x per week in person, async as needed).

**Feature development**: Most of my day is writing React/TypeScript code, implementing designs, and building components.

**Code review**: Reviewing teammates' pull requests, giving feedback, learning from others' approaches.

**Mentoring**: Helping backend developers learning frontend, explaining CSS and React patterns, pair programming when teammates are stuck.

**Cross-team communication**: Working with backend team on API contracts, with sales/support on user needs, with designers on implementation feasibility.

**Testing**: Writing tests for critical components, manual testing of features before PR.

**Documentation**: Documenting component APIs, updating README files, maintaining developer guides for complex systems like Nexus foundation blocks.

**Bug fixes**: Addressing issues reported by internal users, debugging production problems, maintaining existing systems.

## Technical Environment

**Frontend Stack**:
- React with TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- CSS/SCSS and Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lexical for rich text editing
- Azure DevOps for version control and CI/CD

**Backend Interaction**:
- Working with C# backend APIs
- Azure Functions
- Understanding backend constraints to design better frontend solutions

**Tools**:
- VS Code
- Browser dev tools (Chrome/Firefox)
- Postman for API testing
- Git for version control

## Work Style

**Results-focused**: "Work that matters, not the process." I'm judged on what I create, not rigid adherence to hours or processes.

**Self-directed**: Given tasks and expected to deliver by next check-in. I structure my own time and approach.

**Collaborative when needed**: While I work independently most of the time, I proactively communicate with teammates when I need input or when I can help them.

**Problem-solver**: Often the liaison between teams because I can understand both technical and user perspectives.

## Challenges I Handle

**Legacy code**: Working with existing codebases that weren't perfectly architected, refactoring when appropriate while maintaining stability.

**Unclear requirements**: Often need to figure out what stakeholders actually need vs. what they initially ask for.

**Cross-browser compatibility**: Ensuring features work across different browsers and devices.

**Performance with large datasets**: Dashboards displaying thousands of records need careful optimization.

**Team dynamics**: Sometimes mediating between what backend team can provide and what frontend/users need.

## Growth at Nurtur

**Started with primarily Ironhack bootcamp experience, but quickly took on full-stack responsibilities** including solo full-stack projects and architecture decisions.

**Grown into**:
- Trusted contributor on critical systems (Nexus)
- Mentor to backend developers learning frontend
- Solo full-stack capability (Integrations Dashboard)
- Technical leader on Email Editor project
- Go-to person for bridging technical and non-technical teams

**What I've learned**:
- Production system development at scale
- Working in established codebases
- Collaborating with diverse teams
- Long-term maintainability thinking
- Redux Toolkit and complex state management
- Mentoring and knowledge sharing

## Why This Role

This role gave me **real production experience** that's essential for career progression. I went from bootcamp graduate to shipped multiple production systems in 3.5 years, gained mentoring experience, and worked on genuinely complex technical challenges.

The experience at Nurtur has been invaluable for building the foundation I need to move toward AI/robotics and exploration technology work.
