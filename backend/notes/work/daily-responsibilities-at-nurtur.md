# Daily Responsibilities at Nurtur

## Role: Full Stack Developer

**Company**: Nurtur (operating as BriefYourMarket.com)  
**Duration**: July 2022 - February 2026 (3.5 years)  
**Location**: Derby, UK  
**Hours**: 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday to Friday (flexible in practice)

## Primary Responsibilities

### Frontend Development

**React/TypeScript development**: Built and maintained user-facing features across multiple dashboards and tools.

**Component architecture**: Created reusable, maintainable React components that scale across different dashboard types.

**State management**: Implemented Redux Toolkit for complex application state, particularly in Email Editor and Nexus Dashboard.

**Responsive design**: Ensured interfaces worked seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

**Performance optimization**: Kept applications fast and responsive, especially important for data-heavy dashboards.

## Major Projects

### Nexus Dashboard

**Most critical company system**: The main internal dashboard used by multiple teams daily.

**My contributions**:
- Implemented foundation blocks architecture for scalability
- Built reusable dashboard components
- Focused on developer experience (making it easy for teammates to build new features)
- Created safety layers to prevent breaking changes
- Optimized performance for complex data visualizations

**Collaboration**: Worked with backend team on API design, with designers on UX, with other frontend developers on component standards.

### Email Editor

**Team collaboration project**: Built alongside other developers.

**My specific contributions**:
- Implemented Redux Toolkit for editor state management
- Integrated Lexical framework for rich text editing
- Created link editor component
- Mentored backend developers transitioning to frontend work
- Helped deploy to production

**Challenge**: Complex state management (document content, selection, history, collaboration, UI state) required thoughtful architecture.

### Integrations Dashboard

**Solo full-stack project**: Built entirely by me to bridge backend and sales teams.

**Responsibility**:
- Gathered requirements from both technical (backend) and non-technical (sales) stakeholders
- Designed and implemented both frontend and backend
- Deployed to production
- Maintained initially, but it's been stable for 3+ years with zero ongoing maintenance

**Impact**: Increased sales team productivity significantly by making backend data accessible and intuitive.

## Daily Activities

**Standup/check-ins**: Coordinated with team on current tasks and blockers (typically 2x per week in person, async as needed).

**Feature development**: Most of my day was writing React/TypeScript code, implementing designs, and building components.

**Code review**: Reviewed teammates' pull requests, gave feedback, learned from others' approaches.

**Mentoring**: Helped backend developers learning frontend, explained CSS and React patterns, did pair programming when teammates were stuck.

**Cross-team communication**: Worked with backend team on API contracts, with sales/support on user needs, with designers on implementation feasibility.

**Testing**: Wrote tests for critical components, did manual testing of features before PR.

**Documentation**: Documented component APIs, updated README files, maintained developer guides for complex systems like Nexus foundation blocks.

**Bug fixes**: Addressed issues reported by internal users, debugged production problems, maintained existing systems.

## Technical Environment

**Frontend Stack**:
- React with TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- CSS/SCSS and Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lexical for rich text editing
- Azure DevOps for version control and CI/CD

**Backend Interaction**:
- Worked with C# backend APIs
- Azure Functions
- Understood backend constraints to design better frontend solutions

**Tools**:
- VS Code
- Browser dev tools (Chrome/Firefox)
- Postman for API testing
- Git for version control

## Work Style

**Results-focused**: "Work that matters, not the process." I was judged on what I created, not rigid adherence to hours or processes.

**Self-directed**: Given tasks and expected to deliver by next check-in. I structured my own time and approach.

**Collaborative when needed**: While I worked independently most of the time, I proactively communicated with teammates when I needed input or when I could help them.

**Problem-solver**: Often the liaison between teams because I could understand both technical and user perspectives.

## Challenges I Handled

**Legacy code**: Worked with existing codebases that weren't perfectly architected, refactored when appropriate while maintaining stability.

**Unclear requirements**: Often needed to figure out what stakeholders actually needed vs. what they initially asked for.

**Cross-browser compatibility**: Ensured features worked across different browsers and devices.

**Performance with large datasets**: Dashboards displaying thousands of records needed careful optimization.

**Team dynamics**: Sometimes mediated between what backend team could provide and what frontend/users needed.

## Growth at Nurtur

**Started with primarily Ironhack bootcamp experience, but quickly took on full-stack responsibilities** including solo full-stack projects and architecture decisions.

**Grew into**:
- Trusted contributor on critical systems (Nexus)
- Mentor to backend developers learning frontend
- Solo full-stack capability (Integrations Dashboard)
- Technical leader on Email Editor project
- Go-to person for bridging technical and non-technical teams

**What I've learned**:
- Production system development at scale
- Working in established codebases
- Collaborating with diverse teams
- Long-term maintainability thinking
- Redux Toolkit and complex state management
- Mentoring and knowledge sharing

## Why This Role

This role gave me **real production experience** that's essential for career progression. I went from bootcamp graduate to shipped multiple production systems in 3.5 years, gained mentoring experience, and worked on genuinely complex technical challenges.

The experience at Nurtur has been invaluable for building the foundation I need to move toward AI/robotics and exploration technology work.
