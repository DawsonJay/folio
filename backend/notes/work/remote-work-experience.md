# Remote Work Experience and Capabilities

My entire professional career has been remote. All of my roles - from my first position at BriefYourMarket to my current work at Nurtur - have been fully remote positions. I occasionally go into the office for special meetings or events, but my daily work life has always been structured around remote collaboration.

I'm a big fan of remote work and I think it brings out the best in professional communication. Remote collaboration gives me the space to prepare thoughtful questions before reaching out to someone, which means our conversations are always focused and purposeful. When you call someone remotely, it's always for a specific reason, not just because they happen to be nearby. I find this makes it easier to stay focused, professional, and respectful of everyone's time.

Staying productive in remote work comes naturally to me because I genuinely find coding and problem-solving interesting. Most days there isn't anything I'd rather be doing than solving the next technical challenge and building my skills and experience. I stay organized by maintaining a clear list of tasks, breaking problems down into manageable chunks, and working through them systematically. Organization is key to productivity whether you're remote or in an office, but remote work particularly rewards self-direction and focus.

For communication tools, I've used Microsoft Teams extensively at my current company, and previously worked with Discord in other roles. I'm comfortable with various remote collaboration platforms and can adapt to whatever tools a team uses.

Building relationships in remote teams isn't difficult - it just requires intentionality. I think genuine affection and strong working relationships develop naturally when you're helpful and authentic with colleagues. At Nurtur, I often reached out to teams I hadn't spoken to before to gather their thoughts on projects and designs. It's about making the effort to connect around work-relevant topics and maintaining a helpful, professional presence.

I'm completely willing to work remotely during my move to Canada. In fact, this flexibility allows me to start providing value to a new employer immediately while completing my notice period and managing the practical aspects of relocation. Remote work during the transition means I can begin contributing to a team right away rather than waiting until I'm physically in Canada.

I've been working remotely for nearly six years now, and I've developed strong instincts for remote collaboration, async communication, self-directed work, and building relationships across digital spaces. Remote work isn't just something I can do - it's the environment where I've built my entire professional skill set and where I consistently do my best work.
