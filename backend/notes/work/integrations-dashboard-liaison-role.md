# Integrations Dashboard: Liaising Between Technical and Non-Technical Teams

The liaison role in the Integrations Dashboard project required bridging the gap between backend developers who understood the technical system and sales team members who needed to use it but had no technical background. This translation between technical and business perspectives proved as critical as the implementation itself.

The backend developers understood the integration system technically - API structures, data models, processing flows, and technical constraints. They could explain how OAuth worked, why certain operations took time, and what database fields meant. But they didn't understand how sales people actually used integrations in their daily work or what information sales needed versus what was technically available.

The sales team understood their workflows - which clients had which integrations, when integrations broke and how that affected sales, what questions clients asked about integrations, and how integration status impacted deals. But they didn't understand technical concepts, couldn't interpret raw API data, and found technical jargon confusing rather than helpful.

I understood both perspectives through deliberate effort. I talked extensively with backend developers to understand the technical system deeply. I sat with sales team members to learn their workflows and vocabulary. This dual understanding let me translate effectively between groups - explaining technical concepts in business terms and business requirements in technical terms.

The requirements gathering translation converted sales needs into technical specifications. When sales said "I need to see which integrations are broken," I translated that to backend developers as "query integrations table for entries with error status and display with clear visual indicators." When backend developers asked "what fields do they need," I translated sales workflows into specific data requirements. This bi-directional translation ensured we built the right thing.

The design decisions translation helped sales understand technical constraints while helping backend developers understand business priorities. When sales requested instant updates, I explained why polling every few seconds was more practical than real-time websockets given the backend architecture. When backend developers suggested technical features, I evaluated whether they addressed actual sales needs. This translation prevented building technically impressive but useless features.

The terminology bridge translated between technical and business language. "API authentication failure" became "the connection to the service expired" for sales. "The client needs to reconnect their account" became "need to trigger OAuth reauthorization flow" for backend developers. This language translation made communication possible where different vocabularies would create confusion.

The testing involvement translation ensured testing covered what mattered to both sides. Backend developers wanted to test error handling, edge cases, and API failures. Sales wanted to test daily workflows, common scenarios, and interface usability. I ensured we tested both technical robustness and practical usability rather than just one perspective.

The feedback interpretation translated user feedback into actionable technical changes. When sales said "this feels slow," I investigated to determine if it was actual performance issues or perceived delays from inadequate loading indicators. When they said "this is confusing," I determined if it was information architecture or unclear labeling. This interpretation prevented vague feedback from being ignored because it wasn't specific enough.

The training simplification translated technical documentation into user-friendly guides. Backend API documentation is detailed but overwhelming for non-technical users. I created simplified guides explaining what sales needed to know without unnecessary technical detail. This made the dashboard accessible without requiring technical training.

The ongoing communication maintained understanding between groups after launch. When sales reported issues, I translated them into technical bug reports for backend developers. When backend developers made system changes, I translated impact into terms sales understood. This ongoing translation kept both sides informed and aligned.

The trust building through effective translation made both sides comfortable working through me. Backend developers trusted I understood their technical constraints and wouldn't commit them to impossible requests. Sales trusted I understood their needs and wouldn't dismiss them as technically impossible when solutions existed. This mutual trust enabled effective collaboration.

The conflict resolution required understanding both technical and business perspectives to find workable compromises. When sales wanted features that were technically expensive, I helped them understand the cost and find simpler alternatives achieving similar goals. When backend developers pushed back on requirements, I helped clarify what was truly necessary versus nice-to-have. This mediation kept the project moving forward.

The value proposition communication helped both sides understand project value. For backend developers, improving sales team efficiency justified development investment. For sales, better tools meant less daily frustration and more effective client management. Articulating value from both perspectives maintained support and enthusiasm for the project.

From a skills perspective, the liaison role demonstrates communication ability across different knowledge domains, stakeholder management balancing competing interests, requirements translation into actionable specifications, and technical empathy understanding both technical and business perspectives. These soft skills complement technical skills and are essential for projects serving diverse stakeholders.

What I learned from the liaison role is that technical excellence alone doesn't ensure project success. Understanding user needs, translating between groups, managing expectations, and building trust are equally important. Many technically sound projects fail because these human factors are neglected. The Integrations Dashboard succeeded partly because I took the liaison role seriously.

The liaison capability in the Integrations Dashboard demonstrates I can work effectively with non-technical stakeholders, translate between business and technical perspectives, gather and refine requirements across knowledge domains, and deliver systems that serve actual user needs rather than just technical requirements. This ability to bridge between different groups is valuable for any role involving cross-functional collaboration.
