# Email Editor: Team Collaboration and Core Product Rebuild

The Email Editor represents a major team collaboration project at Nurtur rebuilding the core company product - the drag-and-drop email template system for client campaigns. Working in a 4-person team on the company's most critical product demonstrates ability to collaborate on high-stakes projects with shared ownership and coordinated development.

The core product importance meant this wasn't experimental side project but fundamental business infrastructure. Clients use the email editor daily to create campaign templates. The system needed to be reliable, intuitive, and feature-complete. The high visibility and business criticality created pressure to deliver quality work that wouldn't embarrass the team or disrupt client workflows.

The team composition included myself and three backend developers transitioning to full-stack roles. This created mentoring dynamic where I helped backend developers become comfortable with frontend development. The collaboration required coordinating across different experience levels ensuring everyone contributed effectively while developing their skills.

The shared codebase development required coordination and communication. Multiple developers working in the same frontend codebase simultaneously risks conflicts and inconsistencies. We used code reviews, pair programming, clear task division, and regular sync meetings to stay aligned. This collaborative discipline prevents the chaos that derails many multi-developer projects.

The Redux Toolkit state management provided centralized state across the complex editor application. The email template state, undo/redo history, component selections, and editing modes all lived in Redux store. This centralized state management was essential for multiple developers working on different features that needed to interact with shared state. Redux knowledge transfers across Nurtur projects making me valuable for other teams.

The Lexical framework integration for the link editor component demonstrated working with sophisticated text editing libraries. Lexical provides rich text editing capabilities with custom plugins and extensions. Building the link editor required understanding Lexical's architecture, plugin system, and state management. This specialized framework knowledge shows ability to learn complex libraries and integrate them effectively.

The complex component development included implementing intricate UI interactions for drag-and-drop, template editing, component configuration, and preview rendering. These components required careful state management, event handling, and performance optimization. The complexity distinguished this from simple CRUD interfaces, demonstrating capability to build sophisticated interactive applications.

The mentoring role helping backend developers transition to full-stack work was rewarding and demonstrated teaching ability. I explained frontend concepts, reviewed their code with educational feedback, pair programmed on challenging features, and supported their learning. All three backend developers now contribute confidently to the frontend codebase demonstrating successful knowledge transfer.

The production deployment to clients meant the editor needed to work reliably at scale serving actual business needs. This production pressure ensured quality standards and comprehensive testing. The success of the deployment validated our team's work and proved I can deliver on high-stakes projects with real business impact.
