# Natural Leadership: The "Team Dad" Approach

People have called me the "team dad" and it's a description that feels accurate. My leadership style isn't about authority or position - it's about bringing people together, creating spaces where people feel safe to learn and grow, and genuinely caring about the people I work with.

At Nurtur, I've mentored three backend developers who wanted to expand their skills into frontend development. One of them had never worked with CSS before and was intimidated by it. We did pair programming sessions where I'd explain CSS concepts by relating them to backend patterns they already understood - "It's like selecting data from a database, but you're selecting elements from the DOM." That connection helped it click for them. Now all three of them work confidently across the full stack, which has made our team more flexible and effective.

What I've learned about teaching is that it's not about dumping information on someone. It's about understanding where they're starting from, what they're trying to achieve, and building a bridge between those two points. I try to make people feel rock-solid confidence in their ability to learn something, even if it seems difficult at first. Fear and insecurity are the biggest barriers to learning, not capability.

My approach to mentoring is patient and encouraging. I'll work through fundamentals, build understanding step by step, and celebrate improvement rather than fixating on perfection. When someone asks a question, I try to answer in a way that doesn't just solve their immediate problem but helps them understand the underlying principles so they can solve similar problems themselves in the future.

Beyond formal mentoring, I naturally end up in a connecting role on teams. I bridge gaps between people - helping backend developers understand what frontend developers need, translating technical constraints into language non-technical stakeholders can understand, and generally making sure people are communicating effectively. I've found that most conflicts come from misunderstanding rather than genuine disagreement, and often just facilitating clear communication resolves things.

My leadership philosophy is that teams work best when everyone feels they have a stake in the outcome and the psychological safety to contribute honestly. I try to create that environment by being genuinely interested in others' perspectives, admitting when I don't know something, and treating mistakes as learning opportunities rather than failures. When I have technical authority in an area, I'll use it to guide decisions, but I always explain my reasoning and I'm open to being convinced otherwise if someone has a good argument.

I think the "team dad" label comes from this combination of wanting to help people grow, creating safe environments, and genuinely caring about the well-being of the people I work with. I'm not trying to be in charge - I'm trying to help everyone on the team be their best selves and do their best work. That naturally puts me in a leadership role even without formal authority.

What excites me about leadership is seeing people grow. Watching those three backend developers gain confidence in frontend development and seeing them build features they couldn't have tackled before - that's incredibly satisfying. I'd rather help create ten bright sparks of confidence and capability in others than shine brightly alone.

In teams I join, I want to be valuable not just for my technical skills but for how I help the team work together more effectively. Good code matters, but good teams produce sustainable excellence in a way that individual heroics never can. That's the kind of impact I want to have.
