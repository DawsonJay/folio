# Work Experience Timeline

## Current Position

**Full Stack Developer at Nurtur**  
July 2022 - February 2026 (3.5 years)  
Derby, UK

Primary focus on React/TypeScript development for internal dashboards and tools. Major projects include Nexus Dashboard (foundation blocks architecture), Email Editor (Redux Toolkit and Lexical integration), and Integrations Dashboard (solo full-stack project, 3+ years in production with zero maintenance).

**End of role**: Being made redundant. The role provided valuable experience and growth, and this transition aligns with my career goals to pursue more AI/ML and systems work in Canada.

## Previous Experience

### Freelance Web Developer (Self-employed)
March 2021 - June 2022 (15 months)  
United Kingdom

**What I did**: Independent full-stack web development work. Client projects ranging from small business websites to more complex web applications.

**What I learned**: Customer relations, business development, project management, handling ambiguous requirements, working independently.

**Why I left**: I didn't enjoy the customer relations aspect. It was more work (particularly work I don't like) for less money. Being my own boss didn't compensate for the isolation and dealing with clients rather than focusing on technical excellence.

**Key insight**: I prefer working in small teams where I can share clever solutions with people who understand them and share difficult challenges with teammates. The isolation of freelancing made me realize I need collaborative environments.

### Junior Web Developer at BriefYourMarket.com
October 2020 - February 2021 (5 months)  
United Kingdom

**First professional development role**: This position helped me secure my current role at Nurtur (same company, different contract structure).

**Skills**: Full-stack web development basics, working in professional codebases, collaborating with teams, understanding production systems.

**Transition**: This role led directly to freelance period and then back to Nurtur in more senior capacity.

## Pre-Professional Development

### Ironhack Bootcamp (Web Development)
2020

**Intensive full-stack web development bootcamp**: React, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, HTML/CSS.

**Why bootcamp**: After leaving Heriot-Watt University's AI program, I researched the job market and found portfolios mattered more than degrees. Bootcamp promised job-readiness and practical experience, which aligned with my goal of entering tech quickly.

**Outcome**: Successfully transitioned to professional development within months of completing bootcamp.

### Kayaking Instructor
Pre-2020

**Multiple gold medals in kayaking slalom**: Competed at high level while teaching others.

**Teaching experience**: Worked with students of all ages and skill levels, developed patient instruction approach, learned to make people feel capable when attempting difficult things.

**Skills gained**: Leadership, communication, handling pressure, managing stress, encouraging others.

### Artist and Creative Work
Pre-2020 (University and before)

**Fine Art at University (dropped out)**: Learned creative process, visual design, color theory, composition, working in flow states for hours.

**Why I left**: Realized art alone didn't satisfy my intellectual needs. Loved the creativity but wanted more logical/technical challenges. Found coding combined both creative and intellectual aspects.

**Skills retained**: Design sense, intuition about when something "feels right," ability to work intensely on perfecting details, understanding of visual communication.

## Total Time in Development

**Professional experience**: 2.5+ years (October 2020 - Present, with freelance period)

**Self-taught coding**: Started learning years before professional work:
- Taught myself Java before university
- Python for Arduino projects
- C# for Unity game development
- Continued learning through personal projects

**Real development experience**: 4-5 years if counting self-taught work and portfolio projects alongside professional roles.

## Career Progression

**2020**: Bootcamp graduate → First junior role  
**2021**: Freelance (learned I need teams)  
**2022**: Back to Nurtur as Full Stack Developer  
**2023-2024**: Grew into trusted contributor on critical systems, mentor to others  
**2025**: Ready for next step - more AI/ML work, alignment with values, growth toward robotics/exploration

## What This Timeline Shows

**Rapid learning**: From bootcamp to production systems in under a year.

**Clear trajectory**: Bootcamp → Junior role → Freelance experiment → Professional role with increasing responsibility.

**Self-directed growth**: Taught myself coding before bootcamp, continued learning through portfolio projects (WhatNow, moh-ami, Atlantis, Folio).

**Diverse background**: Art → Kayaking → Tech brings breadth of perspectives that inform my work.

**Career pivot**: Decisive transition from art to tech when I realized tech combined creativity with intellectual challenge and practical value.

## Why I'm Looking for New Opportunities

**3.5 years at Nurtur** has given me solid foundation:
- Production system experience
- Team collaboration
- Mentoring capability
- Complex state management
- Full-stack development

**Current transition**: Being made redundant provides opportunity to pursue:
- More AI/ML focused work (built foundations through WhatNow, moh-ami, Folio)
- Alignment with values (exploration, environmental tech, meaningful work)
- Moving to Canada for personal and professional reasons
- Roles with more technical depth and growth potential

**Gratitude for Nurtur**: They gave me valuable experience that prepared me for this next stage. I'm moving forward with appreciation for what I learned and excitement for what's next.
