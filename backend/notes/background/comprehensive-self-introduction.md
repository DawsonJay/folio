# Professional Self-Introduction

I'm a full stack developer who worked at Nurtur for 3.5 years (July 2022 - February 2026), where I built production systems that last for years. I was made redundant in February 2026, which provides an opportunity to pursue the next stage of my career. At Nurtur, I worked on the Nexus project, where I designed and created the frontend of a dashboard from scratch with complete technical ownership. I worked closely with the backend developer and the teams who used the system, sharing designs and having technical discussions to understand what would be most valuable to them.

My strongest technical skills are in frontend development with React and TypeScript - I use them every day and I'm very comfortable building complex, production-ready interfaces. But I think my most valuable skills are actually broader than any specific technology. I have a strong ability to communicate with and understand the perspectives of different teams, which lets me build software that acts as a bridge between technical and non-technical stakeholders. I also have a deep understanding of code structure and architecture, which is why I can build systems that run in production for years with little to no maintenance. My Integrations Dashboard at Nurtur has been running for over three years now without any crashes or bug reports.

What makes me unique as a developer is my creativity and empathy. I started out wanting to be an artist, and those early experiences gave me a broader perspective and skill set than colleagues who have always been developers. I think many developers struggle to see things from other people's perspectives, but I regard that empathy as a core skill for building things that are meant to help people. That empathy and desire to support others is also central to my leadership style - I'm often called the "team dad" because I naturally focus on making sure everyone has what they need to flourish.

My career direction is about becoming an expert while lifting others up. I want to be someone who can build amazing things as part of a team. I want to continuously hone my skills and knowledge, always gathering new experiences. But I don't need to be the smartest or most important person in the room. What drives me is becoming the best version of myself while helping the people around me do the same. I want to use my growing expertise to support and elevate my teammates.

I've been working in professional development for over 5 years now, starting with BriefYourMarket and then at Nurtur for 3.5 years until February 2026. In that time, I've built full-stack applications, worked extensively with AI and machine learning, mentored junior developers, and taken on increasing technical responsibility. I'm looking for opportunities where I can continue that growth trajectory while contributing to meaningful projects with collaborative teams.
