# My Journey from Art and Teaching to Technology

My journey into development started with art. I loved making things and creating, but I realized fine art was too dependent on my mood and public opinion to be a sustainable career. Coding gave me that same creative satisfaction - the joy of bringing ideas into reality - but with clear, objective parameters for success. Code either works or it doesn't. There's feedback, iteration, and craftsmanship, but the path to "good enough" is much clearer than it is in fine art. That clarity is what sparked my interest in tech.

The transition happened through education, though not in the traditional way. I tried studying AI at Heriot Watt University but found it too slow and disconnected from reality. When I had self-taught programming before university, I moved at a blinding pace, but the academic environment was focused on theory over practice. After looking at job listings and seeing that a degree wasn't strictly necessary - that a portfolio and demonstrable skills mattered more - I dropped out with the intent of starting my career without finishing the degree. I did a bootcamp that promised portfolio-building and job readiness, and I got my first web development job at BriefYourMarket shortly after. That practical, hands-on approach has defined my career path ever since.

Kayaking was separate from my career goals. It's a sport I've done since childhood, and I started teaching it as a volunteer during my art and higher education courses as a way to give back to that community. I gave it up when I moved to Edinburgh, but the teaching experience profoundly influenced how I approach mentoring and leadership in tech. Teaching kayaking taught me how to support people's growth, how to create safe spaces for learning, and how to help people discover their own capabilities rather than just instructing them. Those lessons carry directly into how I work with junior developers and how I approach team leadership.

The narrative that connects all my experiences is about creation, problem-solving, and helping others. Art taught me creativity, intuition, and how to work toward a vision through iteration and experimentation. Teaching kayaking taught me how to support growth, communicate clearly about complex skills, and create environments where people feel safe to try and fail. Both experiences inform how I work as a developer - I bring creative problem-solving to technical challenges, I have intuitive understanding of code structure and project health, and my leadership style is focused on supporting and elevating teammates rather than controlling or directing them.

All these experiences shaped me into someone who builds things that last, who communicates effectively across different teams and contexts, and who helps others grow. Whether I'm writing code, designing architecture, or mentoring a colleague, the thread that runs through everything is the same: making things, solving problems, and lifting people up. The path from art and teaching to technology might look unusual, but to me it feels like a natural evolution of the same core drives - just expressed through different mediums and applied to different challenges.
