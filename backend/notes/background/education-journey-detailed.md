# Educational Background and Journey

## Formal Education Summary

### Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp (2020)
**Qualification**: Full-stack web development intensive
**Location**: United Kingdom
**Duration**: 9 weeks intensive + 3 weeks final project

**Curriculum**:
- Frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Full-stack project development
- Agile methodologies
- Git and version control

**Why bootcamp**: After leaving university twice, I researched the job market and found that portfolios and practical skills mattered more than traditional degrees. Bootcamp promised job-readiness and practical experience, which aligned with my goal of entering tech quickly.

**Outcome**: Successfully transitioned to professional development within months of completing. First role (Junior Web Developer at BriefYourMarket.com) came directly after bootcamp.

**Skills gained**: Not just technical skills, but professional development practices - working in teams, code reviews, deployment, real project constraints.

### Heriot-Watt University - Computer Science/AI Program (Dropped Out)
**Period**: Started 2018-2019 (left after ~1 year)
**Field**: Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science
**Location**: Edinburgh, Scotland

**Why I left**:
1. **Portfolio vs. degree**: Research showed employers valued demonstrated projects over degrees. I could build a portfolio faster than completing 4 years.
2. **Minimal learning**: I knew Java before we started and learned very little else. One interesting boolean algebra course, but mostly theoretical.
3. **Disconnected from reality**: Final straw was Python exam on paper with no computer, internet, or reference materials - completely disconnected from how actual development works.
4. **Cost vs. value**: Saving years of tuition and time to build real projects instead.

**What I did gain**:
- Adult independence skills (managing finances, household, time)
- Social connections and networking
- Confirmed my passion for coding was real
- Understanding of what I DON'T need (theoretical CS vs. practical engineering)

**Decision process**: Not impulsive. I analyzed job market requirements, evaluated what university was/wasn't providing, considered alternatives, and made strategic decision based on my career goals.

### Fine Art Degree (Dropped Out)
**Period**: ~2016-2017 (left after 1 year)
**Field**: Fine Art
**Location**: United Kingdom

**Why I pursued art**: I loved creativity, working in flow states for hours, stepping back to see perfect finished work. Strong visual sense and design intuition.

**Why I left**:
1. **Subjectivity**: Struggled with how subjective art value was, dependent on public opinion rather than skill or intrinsic quality.
2. **Career uncertainty**: Path to success felt arbitrary (right connections, right zeitgeist) rather than merit-based.
3. **Intellectual needs**: Art satisfied creative needs but not intellectual/logical needs. I needed both.
4. **Ego and pretension**: Found art world culture difficult - too much ego, not enough substance.

**Discovering coding**: In the time after leaving, I got interested in coding and realized it fulfilled both creative needs (building beautiful systems, elegant solutions) and intellectual needs (logic, problem-solving, systems thinking).

**What I kept**: Design sense, intuition about aesthetics, understanding of visual communication. These directly inform my frontend work and UX thinking.

### A-Levels (Retook to Apply to Heriot-Watt)
**Period**: ~2017-2018
**Purpose**: Needed science/math qualifications for university AI program
**Outcome**: Gained qualifications, got into Heriot-Watt

**Demonstrates**: Willingness to do hard work when it serves clear goals. Spent a year redoing qualifications because I believed university was the path I needed (later learned otherwise, but committed to the path at the time).

## Self-Taught Education (Ongoing)

### Before Formal Computer Science
- **Java**: Self-taught before university because I wanted to understand AI concepts
- **Python**: Learned to work with Arduinos and embedded systems
- **C#**: Taught myself for Unity game development

**Pattern**: I learn what I need to achieve goals that inspire me. Never took a course in these languages - learned through building projects.

### During and After Bootcamp
- **TypeScript**: Learned through professional work and personal projects
- **Redux Toolkit**: Self-taught for Nurtur work (Email Editor, Nexus)
- **Machine Learning**: Contextual bandits for WhatNow, taught myself through implementation
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI APIs and prompt engineering for moh-ami
- **Embedded Systems**: Arduino, sensors, LoRa communication for Atlantis
- **RAG Systems**: Embeddings, semantic search, vector storage for Folio

**Learning style**: Goal-driven, hands-on. I don't "study" technologies - I learn them by building meaningful projects that require them.

## Non-Traditional Education

### Kayaking (Gold Medals + Instructor Certification)
**Skills gained**:
- Handling pressure and competition
- Teaching and communication
- Physical discipline and commitment
- Moving on quickly from mistakes
- Time management (balanced with university)

**Leadership development**: Being an instructor taught me to encourage others, make people feel capable, and create safe spaces for learning.

### Theatre and Creative Work
**Skills gained**:
- Visual communication and design
- Understanding audience perception
- Presentation and storytelling
- Working in collaborative creative environments

**Transfer to tech**: UX is fundamentally the same as art - communicating concepts through images and experience.

## Educational Philosophy

**I don't believe you ever "master" a skill**: You learn enough to reach your current goals. People who stop learning are those who stop setting bigger, more exciting goals.

**Self-directed learning is my superpower**: Many developers wait for training or permission to learn. I teach myself whatever I need to achieve my goals. This makes me adaptable and fast.

**Practical over theoretical**: I learn best by doing, not by studying. This is why bootcamp > university for me, and why my portfolio projects teach me more than courses ever did.

## Why This Path Works

**Unconventional but effective**:
- Two university dropouts → Professional developer in 2+ years
- Bootcamp + self-teaching → Production systems in multiple companies
- Continuous learning → Growing from web dev → AI/ML → robotics

**Demonstrates**:
- Strategic decision-making (leaving when something isn't working)
- Self-awareness (knowing how I learn best)
- Commitment (willing to redo A-levels when needed)
- Results focus (portfolio matters more than credentials)
- Continuous growth (always pursuing bigger goals)

My education is untraditional, but it's produced a developer who ships production systems, learns quickly, and has clear trajectory toward ambitious goals. That's what matters.
