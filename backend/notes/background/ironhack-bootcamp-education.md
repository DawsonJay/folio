# Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp

In May 2020, I completed a 9-week intensive web development bootcamp at Ironhack, which marked a significant turning point in my transition from self-taught hobbyist to professional developer. This wasn't about getting a certificate - it was a strategic decision to bridge my personal project work into structured professional skills and create a foundation for entering the industry.

The bootcamp was full-stack focused, covering both frontend and backend technologies. On the frontend, we worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with particular emphasis on modern JavaScript (ES6+) and React for building user interfaces. On the backend, we learned Node.js with Express for building APIs and MongoDB for database management. The curriculum also covered RESTful API design, authentication and authorization patterns, deployment workflows, and working with version control through Git and GitHub.

What made the bootcamp valuable wasn't just the technical content - it was the intensive, immersive format. Nine weeks of full-time focused development work, building multiple projects from scratch, working under tight deadlines, and collaborating with other developers. This experience taught me how to work under pressure, how to make pragmatic decisions when time is limited, and how to balance perfect solutions with shipped products.

The bootcamp introduced me to professional development practices that I hadn't learned from personal projects. Test-driven development (TDD) became part of my workflow - writing tests first, then code to make tests pass, resulting in more reliable and maintainable code. We learned Agile methodologies including sprint planning, daily standups, and iterative development cycles. Pair programming taught me how to collaborate in real-time on code, explaining my thinking and understanding others' approaches.

Several projects from or immediately after the bootcamp became significant portfolio pieces. I built my first full-stack applications that integrated frontend interfaces with backend APIs and databases. Working with user authentication, session management, database schemas, and deployed applications gave me hands-on experience with concepts that are hard to learn from tutorials alone.

The collaborative aspect was crucial. Working with other bootcamp students meant encountering different problem-solving approaches, debugging code written by others, and learning to communicate technical concepts clearly. Code reviews became a regular practice, both giving and receiving feedback on implementation choices.

Coming out of the bootcamp, I had a structured understanding of full-stack development that supplemented my self-taught knowledge. More importantly, I had a portfolio of projects and the confidence to apply for junior developer positions. Within a few months after completing the bootcamp, I secured my first professional role as a Junior Web Developer at BriefYourMarket, followed by my current position at Nurtur.

The timing was interesting - May 2020 was during COVID-19 lockdowns, so the bootcamp was delivered remotely. This meant learning to collaborate effectively in a distributed environment, which has proven valuable as remote work became more common in tech. The challenges of remote learning - staying focused without physical classroom structure, building relationships through screens, debugging collaboratively without being able to look at the same monitor - prepared me well for remote work dynamics.

What I appreciate most about the bootcamp experience is that it validated my career transition. I went in with self-taught knowledge and personal projects, but uncertainty about whether I could make it professionally. I came out with confidence that I could build production-quality software, work effectively with teams, and continue learning as technology evolves.

The bootcamp wasn't the end of my education - it was more like a launchpad. It gave me the structured foundation and professional practices to build on, but everything since has been continuous learning through building real projects, working in professional environments, and staying current with evolving technologies. That combination of bootcamp foundation plus ongoing practical experience has shaped how I approach development and career growth.
