# Educational and Professional Background

My educational background has been eclectic, shaped more by pursuing what interested me than following a traditional path. I started with a course in fine art at the University of Derby when I thought I wanted to be an artist. I loved making things, but I quickly realized that fine art wasn't sustainable for me professionally - too much depended on my mood and the opinions of others. Coding offered the same creativity and joy of making things, but with clearer parameters for success.

I became interested in AI and decided to study it, but I didn't have the academic credits I needed to apply to university programs. So I went back to school to complete a higher education course specifically to get those credits, then applied to AI courses and was accepted to Heriot Watt University. I only lasted a year there. I was disappointed by the lack of practical knowledge being taught and the disconnect from how technology actually works in the real world. When I had self-taught programming before university, I moved at a blinding pace, but the academic environment was slow and focused on theory rather than application.

After looking at job listings and realizing that a degree wasn't strictly necessary - that what employers wanted was a portfolio and demonstrable skills - I made the decision to drop out and start my career without completing the degree. This turned out to be harder than I expected. After a volunteer position at a game company, I decided to do a bootcamp that promised both a portfolio and job readiness by the end. I completed the bootcamp and got my first web development job at BriefYourMarket shortly after.

I've been working in professional development for over 5 years. My first role at BriefYourMarket gave me practical experience building real systems that actual users depended on. From there I moved to Nurtur, where I worked for 3.5 years (July 2022 - February 2026) building production systems including the Integrations Dashboard and the Nexus Dashboard. I was made redundant at Nurtur in February 2026. Over those years, I progressed from junior developer to someone with significant technical ownership and responsibility.

The path from art to AI to bootcamp to professional development might look unconventional, but each step taught me something valuable. Art taught me creativity and intuition. The AI studies gave me theoretical foundations in machine learning and algorithms. The bootcamp gave me practical web development skills and a portfolio. And six years of professional work have given me production experience, technical depth, and the ability to build systems that last. The non-traditional path means I learned by doing, by failing, by solving real problems - and I think that's made me a better developer than if I had simply followed the traditional university-to-job pipeline.
