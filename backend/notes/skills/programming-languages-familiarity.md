# Programming Languages and Familiarity

## Primary Languages (Daily Professional Use)

**TypeScript/JavaScript**: My strongest languages, used daily for 3.5 years at Nurtur. Deep expertise in React, TypeScript, and modern JavaScript patterns. This is where I have the most production experience and can deliver the most value.

## Backend Languages (Professional Experience)

**C#**: Used extensively as my primary backend language for 3 of my 3.5 years at Nurtur. Worked with C# backend APIs, Azure Functions, and backend systems that supported the frontend dashboards I built. Also used C# in my volunteer game development role and for personal Unity projects. I'm very familiar with C# and comfortable working with it in production environments.

## Academic and Learning Languages

**Java**: The first programming language I learned. Used Java extensively during my Higher Education course and at Heriot Watt University. Java was my foundation for understanding programming concepts, object-oriented design, and algorithmic thinking. While I haven't used it professionally in recent years, I have a solid foundational understanding from my education.

## Personal Project Languages

**Lua**: Familiar with Lua through personal projects. Used for scripting and automation in various side projects.

**Python**: Used extensively for AI/ML projects (WhatNow, moh-ami, Folio), data processing, and embedded systems work. Strong familiarity with Python's data science stack (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy).

## Language Learning Philosophy

I learn languages through projects, not courses. Each language I know came from a specific goal:
- **Java**: Learned to understand AI concepts before university
- **C#**: Learned for Unity game development and then used professionally
- **Python**: Learned for Arduino/embedded systems and AI/ML work
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Learned through bootcamp and professional work

This goal-driven approach means I understand languages in context - I know how to use them to solve real problems in production environments, not just syntax.
