# CSS Frameworks and Styling Experience

## Frameworks Used in Production

### Tailwind CSS

**Primary experience from**:
- **moh-ami project**: Used Tailwind for responsive styling across the entire application
- **Portfolio website**: Extensive Tailwind usage for theatrical diorama design and article system
- **Folio**: Current project uses Tailwind for the AI chatbot interface

**Why I like Tailwind**:
- Utility-first approach matches how I think about styling
- No context switching between HTML and CSS files
- Responsive modifiers make mobile-first design natural
- Purging unused CSS keeps bundle sizes small
- Consistency through design tokens

**Expertise areas**:
- Responsive design with breakpoint modifiers
- Custom theme configuration
- Component extraction for reusable styles
- Integration with React components
- Performance optimization

### Plain CSS/SCSS

**Experience from**:
- Multiple Nurtur projects before adopting Tailwind
- Custom styling for complex visualizations
- Fine-grained control when framework utilities aren't sufficient

**Strengths**:
- Deep understanding of CSS fundamentals (flexbox, grid, positioning, cascade)
- Writing maintainable, scalable CSS architectures
- Performance considerations (specificity, repainting, animation)

## Styling Philosophy

### Component-Driven Styling

From portfolio website and moh-ami work, I learned to:
- Style components in isolation
- Use design tokens for consistency
- Build reusable component variants
- Separate layout from decoration

### Responsive Design

**Mobile-first approach**: Start with mobile layout, enhance for larger screens. This matches how Tailwind works and produces cleaner, more maintainable code.

**Breakpoint strategy**: Define clear breakpoints based on content needs, not device sizes.

### Performance-Conscious

- Minimize CSS bundle sizes through purging and tree-shaking
- Avoid expensive operations (shadows, filters) where not needed
- Use CSS transforms over position changes for animations
- Lazy-load non-critical styles

## Teaching CSS

**Mentoring backend developers**: At Nurtur, I regularly help backend developers transitioning to frontend understand CSS.

**Common challenges I address**:
- The cascade and specificity (why styles sometimes don't apply)
- Flexbox and Grid (spatial layouts)
- Responsive design thinking
- The box model and how sizing really works

**My teaching approach**:
- Relate CSS concepts to backend concepts they already know
- Use visual examples and browser dev tools
- Teach fundamental principles, not just specific properties
- Make people feel okay with not knowing (biggest barrier to learning)

## Design Sense from Art Background

My fine art background influences my styling:

**Eye for balance and proportion**: I can sense when spacing is slightly off or proportions don't feel right. This intuition speeds up styling work.

**Color theory**: Understanding harmony, contrast, and accessibility from art translates directly to choosing color palettes.

**Typography**: Appreciation for how typefaces communicate beyond their literal content. Hierarchy and readability.

**UX as visual communication**: Art is about communicating concepts through images and experience. That's exactly what UX is. My art background makes me naturally consider how visual design affects user understanding and emotion.

## Practical Examples

### Portfolio Website

**Theatrical diorama design**: Complex SVG animations, layered parallax effects, custom theme system with clockwork durations for coordinated animations.

**Technical challenges**:
- Coordinating multiple animated elements
- Responsive layouts that maintained design integrity
- Performance with complex animations
- Accessible animations (respecting prefers-reduced-motion)

### moh-ami

**Clean, accessible interface** for legal document assistance:
- Typography choices that reduced intimidation
- Color palette that felt professional but approachable
- Responsive tables for document sections
- Loading states that felt polished
- Form styling that guided users through complex inputs

### Integrations Dashboard

**Function over form**: Sales team needed clear, fast interfaces. Styling focused on:
- Information density without overwhelming
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Fast load times
- Consistency with existing systems

## Areas for Growth

**CSS-in-JS**: Limited experience with styled-components or emotion. Mostly used Tailwind utility classes or plain CSS modules.

**Advanced animations**: While I can do complex animations, I haven't worked with animation libraries like Framer Motion extensively.

**Design systems at scale**: Experience with component libraries for specific projects, but not maintaining company-wide design systems.

## The Bottom Line

I'm proficient with Tailwind CSS and CSS fundamentals, with a strong design sense from my art background. I can build responsive, accessible, performant interfaces and teach CSS to others effectively. My styling serves user needs first - elegant where appropriate, functional always.
