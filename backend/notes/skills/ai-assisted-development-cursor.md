# AI-Assisted Development with Cursor

I use Cursor extensively in all my development work, and I think it represents a valuable skill that's becoming increasingly important in modern software development. The way I use AI assistance isn't about having it write all my code - it's about working at a higher level of abstraction and maintaining focus on what matters most.

I use Cursor in a high-level way that helps me focus on the structure of code rather than getting bogged down in the details of syntax. When I'm building a system, what matters most is the architecture - how components fit together, what the interfaces should be, how data flows through the system. Cursor lets me stay focused at that architectural level while it handles more of the mechanical aspects of implementation. I'm thinking about the forest, and it's helping with the trees.

Cursor is also a powerful learning tool for me. When I encounter niche uses of a language or framework feature I'm not deeply familiar with, I can ask targeted questions and get explanations with working code examples. It's like having an expert in every technology I work with, available instantly. This accelerates my learning significantly - instead of spending hours reading documentation to understand one specific pattern, I can see it implemented and explained in context.

The skill in using Cursor effectively is more about sensitivity to project structure and phrasing questions correctly than it is about prompting an AI to write code. I need to understand the architecture well enough to know what I'm asking for and to recognize whether what it generates actually fits into the larger system. I need to break problems down into clear, well-scoped pieces. I need to review and understand what it produces rather than just accepting output blindly.

I also use Cursor strategically to control development in a modular way and prevent sweeping changes. When working on large systems, uncontrolled changes can ripple through the codebase in unpredictable ways. I structure my work and my interactions with Cursor to make targeted, contained changes rather than letting it refactor entire systems at once. This modular approach keeps development manageable and maintainable.

Documentation is another area where Cursor adds tremendous value. I use it to create extensive documentation and development records that make it easy for the next developer - including future me - to understand the structure and decisions behind the code. Good documentation is time-consuming to write manually, but with AI assistance, I can maintain much more thorough documentation without it becoming a burden. This pays off enormously in long-term maintainability.

The broader skill here is knowing how to work effectively with AI development tools. It's about understanding what they're good at and what they're not, knowing when to trust their output and when to verify more carefully, being able to guide them effectively toward useful results, and maintaining proper oversight of the code that goes into production. As AI tools become more common in software development, knowing how to use them effectively while maintaining quality standards is becoming a crucial professional skill.
