# Python for AI/ML Projects

I've been familiar with Python for around 7 years, but I only started using it in a more focused way in the past year as I began building AI and machine learning projects. Python is not my primary language - TypeScript and React are my core strengths - but I've developed solid Python skills specifically for AI/ML work and backend APIs that support AI systems. My experience centers around FastAPI as my framework of choice for building AI-powered backends.

Over the past year, I've built several AI-focused projects using Python and FastAPI. I've created RESTful APIs that integrate with AI systems, handle embeddings and vector search, and serve LLM-powered applications. I'm comfortable with async/await patterns for handling concurrent operations, which is important for responsive AI APIs. The type hints and automatic OpenAPI documentation generation in FastAPI make it a great choice for building maintainable AI backends.

My Python work spans several domains. I've integrated machine learning and AI systems into production applications, including contextual bandits for reinforcement learning in WhatNow, LLM integration with OpenAI APIs in both moh-ami and my current Folio project, and attempted weather prediction models in Cirrus. I'm experienced with data processing at scale - in the Cirrus project I processed 56 million weather records using NumPy, Pandas, and multiprocessing for performance optimization.

For database work, I primarily use PostgreSQL with various ORMs and adapters. I've worked with SQLAlchemy for traditional ORM patterns, Prisma for type-safe database access (in TypeScript projects that use Python backends), and direct psycopg2 connections when needed. I understand database schema design, migrations, indexing for performance, and query optimization.

Beyond web frameworks and databases, I have experience with scientific Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and GeoPandas for data manipulation and analysis. I've used scikit-learn for machine learning pipelines and XGBoost for gradient boosting models. For spatial data work in Cirrus, I worked with KD-tree structures for efficient nearest-neighbor queries and implemented custom interpolation algorithms that processed over 21,000 records per second.

I follow Python best practices including virtual environments for dependency isolation, requirements.txt for dependency management, proper error handling and logging, and writing clean, readable code. I'm comfortable with Python's ecosystem of tools and can quickly pick up new libraries as needed for specific project requirements.

What I particularly appreciate about Python is how well it serves the AI/ML ecosystem. The libraries, frameworks, and community support for AI work in Python are unmatched. While I'm strongest in TypeScript and React for frontend work, Python has become my tool of choice specifically for AI projects - building RAG systems, integrating LLMs, working with embeddings, and creating AI-powered backends. It's a supporting skill that complements my primary frontend expertise and enables me to build full-stack AI applications.
