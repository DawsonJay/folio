# Build Tools and Development Infrastructure Experience

I have extensive experience with modern build tools and development infrastructure across the full stack. My approach to build tools is pragmatic - I care about developer experience, build performance, and reliability rather than using the latest trendy tool. I've worked with enough different systems to understand the tradeoffs and choose appropriately for each project.

For frontend bundling and build tools, I'm very comfortable with Vite and Webpack. Vite is my preferred choice for new projects because of its exceptional development speed and modern defaults - the hot module replacement is blazingly fast and the out-of-the-box TypeScript support is excellent. I've used it extensively in my portfolio website, Folio, and other recent projects. I also have significant Webpack experience from earlier projects and production systems at Nurtur, including complex configuration for optimization, code splitting, and asset management.

For React projects specifically, I've worked with Create React App, Next.js, and raw Vite setups. Next.js is particularly interesting because it combines framework features with build optimization - I've used both the Pages Router and newer App Router in production projects like moh-ami. The integrated server-side rendering, API routes, and automatic code splitting make Next.js a powerful choice for full-stack React applications.

Package management and task running is something I deal with daily. I'm comfortable with npm, yarn, and pnpm, and I use npm scripts extensively for build automation, testing, and development workflows. I prefer keeping build scripts simple and readable rather than introducing complex task runners unless the project genuinely needs that complexity.

For transpilation and type checking, I work with both Babel and the TypeScript compiler regularly. TypeScript compilation is part of my daily workflow since I write TypeScript for all modern JavaScript projects. I understand the configuration options, how to set up different compile targets, and how to integrate TypeScript checking into build pipelines.

For CSS tooling, I've worked with Sass/SCSS compilation, Tailwind CSS CLI, and CSS Modules. Each has its place - Sass for complex component libraries, Tailwind for utility-first development, CSS Modules for component-scoped styles. I can work effectively with any of them and understand when each approach is appropriate.

Beyond frontend tools, I have experience with Docker containerization for development and deployment, and I've worked with CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment. I've set up workflows that run tests, build applications, and deploy to various platforms based on branch and tag rules.

What matters most to me about build tools isn't which specific ones I've used, but that I understand the build process deeply enough to debug problems, optimize performance, and make informed decisions about tooling. I can read build configurations, understand what's happening under the hood, and solve issues when builds break. Build tools are means to an end - good developer experience and reliable production builds - and I focus on those outcomes rather than getting attached to particular tools.
