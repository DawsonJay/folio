# Python Backend Development Experience

I've been working with Python for backend development for over 3 years now, and it's become my primary language for building server-side applications and APIs. My experience centers around FastAPI as my main framework, which I've used extensively across multiple production projects.

In my professional work and personal projects, I've built RESTful APIs using FastAPI that handle everything from simple CRUD operations to complex data processing pipelines. I'm comfortable with async/await patterns for handling concurrent operations, which is crucial for building responsive APIs. The type hints and automatic OpenAPI documentation generation in FastAPI have made my code more maintainable and easier to collaborate on.

My Python work spans several domains. I've integrated machine learning and AI systems into production applications, including contextual bandits for reinforcement learning in WhatNow, LLM integration with OpenAI APIs in both moh-ami and my current Folio project, and attempted weather prediction models in Cirrus. I'm experienced with data processing at scale - in the Cirrus project I processed 56 million weather records using NumPy, Pandas, and multiprocessing for performance optimization.

For database work, I primarily use PostgreSQL with various ORMs and adapters. I've worked with SQLAlchemy for traditional ORM patterns, Prisma for type-safe database access (in TypeScript projects that use Python backends), and direct psycopg2 connections when needed. I understand database schema design, migrations, indexing for performance, and query optimization.

Beyond web frameworks and databases, I have experience with scientific Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and GeoPandas for data manipulation and analysis. I've used scikit-learn for machine learning pipelines and XGBoost for gradient boosting models. For spatial data work in Cirrus, I worked with KD-tree structures for efficient nearest-neighbor queries and implemented custom interpolation algorithms that processed over 21,000 records per second.

I follow Python best practices including virtual environments for dependency isolation, requirements.txt for dependency management, proper error handling and logging, and writing clean, readable code. I'm comfortable with Python's ecosystem of tools and can quickly pick up new libraries as needed for specific project requirements.

What I particularly appreciate about Python is how it lets me move quickly from idea to working prototype, while still being powerful enough for production systems. Whether it's building APIs, processing data, integrating AI models, or solving complex algorithmic problems, Python has been my go-to tool for backend development.
