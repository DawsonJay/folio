      "answer": "In my professional experience, I have primarily focused on TypeScript and React for frontend development, leveraging these technologies daily. However, when it comes to backend development, I have utilized GraphQL extensively in my projects, particularly in moh-ami, where I designed and implemented the backend. The choice of GraphQL over REST was a strategic decision aimed at enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of data retrieval in my applications. This experience showcases my understanding of modern API design principles and my ability to create robust backend solutions that integrate well with frontend frameworks.\n\nWhile GraphQL has been my primary technology for backend APIs, I am also familiar with Python, which I've been using for about seven years. My experience with Python has evolved significantly in the past year as I have begun to focus more on building AI and machine learning projects. This includes exploring various libraries and frameworks that facilitate machine learning and data manipulation, further expanding my backend capabilities.\n\nAlthough my strongest technical skills lie in TypeScript and React, my experience with GraphQL and Python equips me with a versatile skill set for backend development. I have extensive experience with modern build tools and development infrastructure, which complements my backend knowledge, allowing me to create seamless integrations between frontend and backend systems. This full-stack approach enables me to tackle complex projects effectively, ensuring that both the client-side and server-side components work harmoniously together.\n\nIf you’d like to see an example of my work with GraphQL, you can check out the moh-ami project, which is an ongoing project showcasing my skills in API design and implementation.
