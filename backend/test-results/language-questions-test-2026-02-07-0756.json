      "answer": "In my professional journey, I have developed strong expertise in several backend languages, although my primary focus has been on JavaScript through Node.js and Python, particularly in the context of building applications and services. JavaScript is my go-to language for backend development, as I utilize it extensively in conjunction with TypeScript and frameworks like Express.js to create robust server-side applications. My comfort with JavaScript allows me to maintain a seamless transition between frontend and backend development, enabling full-stack capabilities that enhance my project outcomes.\n\nOver the past year, I have also delved deeper into Python, which I have been familiar with for around seven years. My interest in Python intensified as I began to build AI and machine learning projects. This shift required me to leverage Python's extensive libraries and frameworks, such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn, to create intelligent applications. My growing proficiency in Python complements my existing skills and allows me to tackle complex data-driven tasks effectively.\n\nIn terms of API design and implementation, I have been particularly focused on GraphQL with my moh-ami project. The backend for moh-ami uses GraphQL as a deliberate architectural choice, showcasing my understanding of modern API design principles. By opting for GraphQL over REST, I aimed to provide more flexibility and efficiency in data retrieval, which can significantly enhance the performance of client applications. This experience has deepened my comprehension of API interactions and the importance of effective data management in application development.\n\nOverall, while I primarily work with JavaScript and Node.js for backend development, my expanding expertise in Python, coupled with my experience in GraphQL, positions me well to tackle a diverse range of backend challenges.

My experience encompasses various domains of AI and machine learning, where I prioritize building systems that are not just theoretical but also functional in production environments. I've developed a range of projects that leverage Python's capabilities to create effective AI solutions.\n\nIn my recent efforts, I've integrated and worked with Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple projects, gaining hands-on experience that allowed me to understand the intricacies of deploying these complex models in a live setting. This experience includes not only the technical aspects, such as fine-tuning models and optimizing their performance, but also understanding their limitations and how to effectively manage those in a production context.\n\nMy educational background is quite eclectic, reflecting my interests rather than adhering to a conventional path. Initially, I engaged in a course that sparked my interest in fine arts, but my journey evolved as I explored various fields, ultimately leading me to the intersection of technology and creativity. This diverse background has shaped my approach to problem-solving and innovation.\n\nI have a core philosophy that emphasizes \"Work That Matters, Not the Process.\" This means I prefer to be evaluated based on the outcomes of my work rather than the methodologies I employ. For instance, if I need to take a couple of days to hike and brainstorm ideas with a notebook in hand, I find that it often leads to more creative and impactful results. \n\nOverall, my journey in Python, particularly in the realm of AI and machine learning, has been marked by a commitment to practical application, creativity, and a focus on delivering meaningful work that resonates in the real world.",
