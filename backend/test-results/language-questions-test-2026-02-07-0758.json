      "answer": "In my technical journey, I have primarily focused on TypeScript and React for frontend development, which I use daily and have strong expertise in. While my frontend skills are robust, my backend experience is centered around Python and GraphQL. I have been familiar with Python for about seven years, but I have recently started applying it more intensively, particularly in the context of AI and machine learning projects. This transition allowed me to explore backend development more deeply, especially in terms of data processing and algorithm implementation for intelligent applications.\n\nIn backend development, one of my key projects is moh-ami, where I designed and implemented a GraphQL API. This choice to use GraphQL instead of the more traditional REST architecture reflects my understanding of modern API design practices. GraphQL offers advantages such as more efficient data fetching and flexibility in how clients can request data, which is increasingly important in today's application landscape. The moh-ami project showcases my ability to leverage advanced technologies to build scalable and efficient systems. You can check out the project at [moh-ami demo](https://moh-ami-production.up.railway.app/) and find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/DawsonJay/moh-ami).\n\nI also have extensive experience with build tools and development infrastructure, which plays a crucial role in both frontend and backend development. I approach these tools with pragmatism, ensuring that I can streamline workflows and improve efficiency throughout the development process. This holistic understanding of both frontend and backend technologies allows me to create cohesive and well-architected applications that meet user needs effectively. As I continue to evolve my skill set, I am eager to explore further opportunities that allow me to leverage my backend knowledge alongside my strong frontend capabilities.",

My primary focus was on React and TypeScript for frontend development, which I have been using for over three years. This experience allowed me to effectively create dynamic and responsive user interfaces that enhance user experience. Additionally, React's component-based architecture enabled me to build scalable applications that are maintainable over time.\n\nOn the backend, I primarily worked with Node.js, which allowed me to develop server-side applications efficiently. This environment facilitated the creation of RESTful APIs, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend. I often used Express.js for routing and middleware management, streamlining the development process. Furthermore, I integrated various databases, including MongoDB and PostgreSQL, depending on the project requirements, ensuring data persistence and effective query handling.\n\nOne of the major projects I contributed to was the Email Editor, a core product rebuild that emphasized team collaboration. This project required not only technical expertise in the aforementioned languages but also effective communication with team members to align on project goals and deliverables. The drag-and-drop functionality we implemented significantly improved user engagement and satisfaction, showcasing the importance of user-centered design in our development process.\n\nThroughout my tenure at Nurtur, I also emphasized best practices, such as unit testing and version control with Git, to ensure that the code was robust and maintainable. This focus on quality helped to deliver features that not only met user needs but also adhered to coding standards and best practices within the industry.
