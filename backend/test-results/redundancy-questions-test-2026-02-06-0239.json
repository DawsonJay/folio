I understand the practical realities of moving internationally, including the financial implications, and I am seeking a role that provides the stability I need during this transition.\n\nWhat makes me stand out to potential employers is the breadth of my experience. I bring more than just coding skills to the table; I offer creativity, thoughtfulness, and diverse perspectives gained from my background in art, teaching, and even kayaking. This unique combination allows me to approach problems from various angles and contribute meaningfully to a team.\n\nLooking ahead, I have a clear vision for where I want to be in five years.

      "answer": "The question is a little vague - I'm better with more specific questions, but I'll try my best: I am currently a Full Stack Developer at Nurtur, where I've been working since July 2022. My primary focus has been on React and TypeScript development for internal dashboards. This role has significantly contributed to my growth, allowing me to enhance my technical skills and work collaboratively within a talented team. I have enjoyed my time at Nurtur and appreciate the support they have provided in my professional development.\n\nHowever, after more than two years, I feel that I've achieved what I set out to do in this role. I'm looking for new opportunities not because of any dissatisfaction with Nurtur, but rather as a natural progression in my career. I believe that continuous growth is essential, and I am eager to take on new challenges that will allow me to further develop my skill set and make meaningful contributions.\n\nAs part of this growth journey, I am actively pursuing relocation to Canada. This is not just an option for me; it is a definitive plan. I am excited about the opportunities that await me there, both personally and professionally. I am committed to finding a role that aligns with my goals and values, where I can leverage my experience and continue to evolve as a developer.\n\nIn summary, I am looking for a new opportunity that offers the chance to grow my skills and contribute to impactful projects. I am particularly interested in environments that foster innovation and collaboration, where I can work on exciting technologies and take on more responsibility. If you have any specific questions about my experience or what I am looking for, feel free to ask!",
