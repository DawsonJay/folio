This situation has prompted me to think about my next steps seriously, particularly regarding my immigration goals. I am actively pursuing permanent residence in Canada through the Working Holiday Visa pathway, which is not only a personal aspiration but also a strategic move to secure a stable role in a country that aligns with my values and lifestyle aspirations. \n\nThe redundancy has motivated me to seek opportunities that not only match my skills in web development but also support my goal of relocating to Canada. I understand that moving internationally can be quite expensive, and having a stable role is crucial for making this transition as seamless as possible. My focus on web development roles comes from the understanding that this field is not only in demand but also allows me to leverage my creativity and technical skills. I believe that my diverse background—including experiences in art, teaching, and kayaking—enables me to bring a unique and thoughtful perspective to web development, which can be beneficial to potential employers. \n\nMoreover, Canada represents a perfect fit for my personal and professional aspirations. The culture, the communities, and the opportunities available align well with my vision for a fulfilling life. I am excited about the potential to contribute to projects that resonate with my values while continuing to grow my skills in a new environment.

I am looking for roles where I can further enhance my skills, particularly in full-stack development, and make meaningful contributions to projects. My focus is on finding opportunities that allow me to grow, rather than just climbing the corporate ladder without purpose. I want to engage in work that has a significant impact, whether that’s through innovative tech solutions or collaborative team efforts.\n\nOverall, while my redundancy at Nurtur was not my choice, I see it as a pivotal moment to pivot into something that aligns more closely with my aspirations. I am excited about the potential to contribute to a new team and continue my professional journey in a new and dynamic environment.",
