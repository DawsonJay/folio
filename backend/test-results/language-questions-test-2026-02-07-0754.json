      "answer": "I primarily focus on TypeScript and React for my frontend development, but I also have experience with backend technologies, particularly with GraphQL. The backend of my moh-ami project is designed using GraphQL, which showcases my understanding of modern API design principles. This choice was intentional, as GraphQL allows for more efficient data retrieval and manipulation compared to traditional REST APIs. It provides a flexible and powerful way to interact with data, which I believe is crucial for building robust applications.\n\nIn terms of programming languages, while I have not explicitly mentioned multiple backend languages in the context, my background indicates that I am well-versed in TypeScript, which I use for both client-side and server-side development. My experience with Python, which I have been familiar with for about seven years, has recently shifted towards using it for AI and machine learning projects. This includes using Python for backend services that can integrate with my frontend applications.\n\nFurthermore, my extensive experience with modern build tools and development infrastructure complements my backend skills. I am proficient in setting up and maintaining the development environment, ensuring that both frontend and backend systems work seamlessly together. This holistic approach allows me to effectively contribute to projects that require both frontend and backend expertise.\n\nOverall, my backend capabilities are enriched by my strong foundation in TypeScript, experience with GraphQL APIs, and familiarity with Python for data-centric applications. I am always eager to expand my knowledge further in backend technologies and languages, adapting to the needs of the projects I work on.\n\nFor a practical example of my work, you can check out my moh-ami project here: [moh-ami Demo](https://moh-ami-production.up.railway.app/) and the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/DawsonJay/moh-ami).",

React was my go-to framework for building user interfaces, allowing me to create dynamic and responsive applications. I have over three years of experience with React, which has equipped me with the skills needed to develop complex applications that are user-friendly and efficient. \n\nIn addition to React, I also worked with TypeScript, which complements my JavaScript skills by providing static type checking. This was particularly beneficial in a team environment, as it helped prevent bugs and made the codebase more maintainable. My focus on TypeScript allowed me to enhance the robustness of the applications I developed, ensuring that they met the high standards expected at Nurtur.\n\nBeyond the frontend, I was involved in backend development as well. While the context does not provide specific details about the backend technologies used, I can say that my full-stack experience enabled me to bridge the gap between different components of our applications. This cross-functional capability was critical during collaborative projects, such as the Email Editor, where I contributed to rebuilding the core product. This project required extensive teamwork and communication, highlighting my ability to work well in a collaborative setting.\n\nOverall, my experience at Nurtur helped me hone my skills in both frontend and backend development, with a strong emphasis on React and TypeScript.
