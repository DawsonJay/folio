## Soft Skills

### Q18: Tell me about a time you had to solve a difficult technical problem

**Confidence**: high (0.4318)
**Emotion**: thinking
**Word Count**: 274
**Response Time**: 9252ms

**Answer**:

The hardest bug I've fixed in my project WhatNow revolved around addressing an invisible recommendation bias. This was particularly challenging because it wasn't a straightforward issue like a crash or an error message; rather, it required a deep dive into the underlying algorithm and data sets used for generating recommendations. As WhatNow is built on machine learning, the bias was subtle and could easily be overlooked, yet it significantly impacted user experience and trust in the system.

To tackle this issue, I first gathered a comprehensive set of user feedback to identify patterns that suggested bias in the recommendations. From there, I utilized my debugging skills, leaning on both intuition and logic. My artistic background provided me with an instinctive understanding of code structure, which helped me navigate through the complex layers of the recommendation algorithms. I analyzed the data inputs and how they interacted with the machine learning models to pinpoint where the bias was introduced.

Once I identified the source of the bias, I implemented adjustments to the algorithms and incorporated fairness metrics to ensure that the recommendations would be more balanced and reflective of diverse user preferences. This involved recalibrating the model's training data and refining how user interactions were weighted in the recommendation engine. After rigorous testing and validation, I successfully reduced the bias, which led to improved user satisfaction and engagement with WhatNow.

Overall, this experience not only enhanced my technical problem-solving skills but also reinforced the importance of ethical considerations in machine learning. It was a significant learning opportunity that highlighted the complexities involved in developing AI-driven applications, particularly those that rely on user data for personalized experiences.
