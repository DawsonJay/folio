## Background & Introduction

### 1. Tell me about yourself

**Breakdown:**
- What's your current role and how long have you been there?
- What are your main responsibilities?
- What are your strongest technical skills?
- What makes you unique as a developer?
- Where do you see your career heading?

_Answer:_

I currently work as a full stack developer at Nurtur. I'm working on something called the Nexus project where I am designing and creating the frontend of a dashboard from scratch with complete technical ownership. I work closely with the developer working on the backend of the dashboard and with the teams who will be using it, sharing designs and having technical discussions to find out what will be of the most value to them.
I'm strongest in frontend development using React and TypeScript. However I think my strongest and most useful skills are my ability to communicate with and understand the perspective of various teams so I can build software that is a bridge between them, and my understanding of code structure, which allows me to build software that lasts for years with little to no maintenance. 
I think my creativity and empathy make me unique as a developer. I started out wanting to be an artist, and those early experiences gave me a broader perspective and skillset than my colleagues who have always been developers. I think a lot of developers have trouble seeing from other people's perspective too and I regard that as a core skill for building things that are meant to help people. I think that empathy and desire to support is key to my leadership ability too.
I want to be an expert. Someone who can build amazing things, and who does it as part of a team. I want to hone my skills and knowledge and always be gathering new experiences. And I want to use that to lift up the people around me too. I don't need to be the smartest or most important person in the room, I just need to feel like I'm becoming the best version of myself that I can be, and I want that for others too.

### 2. What's your background?

**Breakdown:**
- What's your educational background? (bootcamp, university, self-taught)
- What was your career path before development? (art, teaching, kayaking)
- How did you transition into tech?
- How long have you been a professional developer?
- What was your first development role?

_Answer:_
My educational background has been eclectic at best. I started out doing a course in fine art at the University of Derby when I thought I wanted to be an artist. I quickly found out that as much as I loved making things, I couldn't do fine art professionally as too much depended on my mood and the opinions of the public. Coding isn't like that, code has very clear parameters for if it is successful or not. Coding let me have that same creativity and joy of making things, but in a more stable way. I was drawn to AI so I decided to study that instead. I didn't have the credits I needed to apply so I went back to school to do a higher education course to get those credits, then I applied for AI courses and got accepted to Heriot Watt. I only lasted a year there too. I was disappointed by the lack of real knowledge being taught and the disconnect from reality. When I had self-taught programming before that I moved at a blinding pace, but university was slow and focused on the wrong things. After looking at job listings and seeing that a degree wasn't strictly needed, just a portfolio, I dropped out with the intent of starting my career without a degree. This was harder than I thought and after a volunteer job at a game company I decided to do a bootcamp that promised a portfolio and job readiness by the end. I completed it and got my first web dev job at BriefYourMarket shortly after. I've been working in development for nearly 6 years.

### 3. What's your story?

**Breakdown:**
- How did you get into development? (what sparked the interest)
- What was your journey from art/teaching/kayaking to tech?
- What key experiences shaped your career path?
- How do your diverse experiences (art, teaching, kayaking) influence your work as a developer?
- What's the narrative that connects all your experiences?

_Answer:_

My journey into development started with art - I loved making things and creating, but I realized fine art was too dependent on my mood and public opinion. Coding gave me that same creative satisfaction but with clear, objective parameters for success. That's what sparked my interest in tech.

The transition happened through education - I tried studying AI at university but found it too slow and disconnected from reality. I dropped out, did a bootcamp, and got my first web dev job. That practical, hands-on approach has defined my career path ever since.

Kayaking was separate from my career goals - it's a sport I've done since childhood. I started teaching it as a volunteer to give back to that community, mostly during my art and higher education courses. I gave it up when I moved to Edinburgh, but the teaching experience influenced how I approach mentoring and leadership in tech.

The narrative that connects everything is about creation, problem-solving, and helping others. Art taught me creativity and intuition. Teaching kayaking taught me how to support people's growth and create safe spaces for learning. Both experiences inform how I work as a developer - I bring creative problem-solving, intuitive understanding of code structure, and a leadership style focused on supporting teammates rather than controlling them.

All these experiences shaped me into someone who builds things that last, communicates across teams, and helps others grow. That's the thread that runs through everything - making things, solving problems, and lifting people up.

### 4. How would you describe yourself?

**Breakdown:**
- What are your core personality traits?
- How would you describe your work style?
- What are your core values?
- How do others describe you?
- What's your approach to work and life?

_Answer:_
I am creative and supportive. I generally gravitate to being the leader of any group because it's my reflex to look after the people around me and make sure they have everything they need to flourish. I tend to take responsibility for them and make sure everyone is organised. In team projects at uni I was often called the "team dad". I don't particularly need to be in charge though, as I said I like to support people and if there's an established hierarchy I have no problem acting as a social glue, pulling a team together but letting someone else take the lead. For me it's not about ego, it's about creating an environment where everyone can be the best they can be.
On the creative side, I love making things, that hasn't changed at all since my past in art, I love designing projects and watching them grow and develop into something physical and real.
My core values are wonder and connection. I love discovery, finding new things and experiences, finding the magic in the world and reflecting that in what I create. Connection is about both forming meaningful connections with people and also sharing that wonder with them.
I think others would describe me as friendly, funny, creative, probably a little weird. But also genuine and caring.

## Remote Work & Work Style

### 5. Are you open to remote work?

**Breakdown:**
- Have all your professional roles been remote?
- What's your experience with remote collaboration?
- Are you willing to work remotely during your move to Canada?
- How do you stay productive in remote work?
- What tools do you use for remote communication?
- How do you build relationships with remote teams?

_Answer:_
_(Include: entire career has been remote, willing to work remotely during Canada move, extensive remote experience)_
Yes, all of my professional roles have been remote. I do go into the office sometimes, for certain meetings or special occasions and I don't have any problem with that, but my daily work life has always been fully remote. 
I'm a big fan of remote collaboration. I find that it gives me the space to think of a list of really good questions to ask before I call someone, and I like that our conversations are always about the problem at hand. I think it's easier to be focused and professional when you work remotely, as when you call someone it's always for a purpose, not just because they're there.
I stay productive by having a clear list of things I need to work on, breaking problems down into manageable chunks and working through them. I think organisation is key, but I think it's key for office work too. I think the reason I don't get distracted with remote work is because I find coding and problem solving genuinely interesting and most days there isn't anything I'd rather be doing than solving the next problem and building my skills and experience.
The company I currently work for uses Microsoft Teams, though previously I've also used Discord.
I don't think it's difficult to build relationships in remote teams. I think it's easier to remain professional, but there's still genuine affection between coworkers. I think anyone will like you if you're helpful and genuine when they ask you for help. One of the difficulties is making new connections, but in my work I often have to reach out to teams I haven't spoken to before to get their thoughts on the project and design, so really it's just about making the effort and having something work relevant to talk about. I think that as long as people are open to helping you as long as you're polite, it doesn't matter too much if you maintain a close relationship with everyone in the company, it's more the environment that matters.

### 6. How do you prefer to communicate?

**Breakdown:**
- Do you prefer async or synchronous communication?
- When do you use written communication vs video calls?
- What communication tools do you prefer? (Slack, email, etc.)
- How do you handle urgent vs non-urgent communication?
- How do you ensure clarity in remote communication?
- What communication style works best for you?

_Answer:_
_(Include: async vs sync, written vs video, communication tools, etc.)_
Usually I prefer a call, but where beforehand I've clearly laid out the problem and have some very clear questions I can ask. I don't like wasting someone's time because I haven't bothered to prepare and I don't like having to ring someone back because i didn't ask for what i actually needed. I like to treat other people's time as valuable and to honour that. So I establish what i really need before getting in touch. A call is usually a lot more friendly and enjoyable than text though and unless things are in a dire rush i'll usually go for a call as its much easier to express complex problems in that medium. if things are in a rush i'll ask my prepared questions in a text, usually phrased so they can answer in just a few words.

## Career Goals & Motivation

### 8. What are you looking for in a company?

**Breakdown:**
- What kind of growth opportunities are you seeking?
- What work culture do you thrive in?
- What values do you want a company to have?
- What size team do you prefer?
- What kind of projects interest you?
- What support do you need for professional development?

_Answer:_
_(Diplomatic answer focusing on growth, meaningful work, team culture - avoid excluding employers)_
I'm looking for opportunities where I can grow my skills and make a meaningful 
contribution. I thrive in collaborative environments where the focus is on 
delivering quality work and supporting team success. 

I'm particularly energized by projects that solve real problems and where I can 
see the impact of my work. I value companies that invest in their people's 
development and provide opportunities for leadership growth.

I'm adaptable and can find value in different team structures and project types. 
What matters most to me is being part of a team where I can contribute meaningfully, 
continue learning, and help build things that matter.

[Optional: If they ask about specific preferences]
I've found I work best in smaller, collaborative teams where everyone is 
motivated and believes in the project, but I'm flexible and can adapt to 
different team structures. I'm drawn to work that has real-world impact, 
whether that's through technology, innovation, or solving meaningful problems.

### 9. What makes you unique?

**Breakdown:**
- How does your art background influence your development work?
- How does your teaching experience help you as a developer?
- How does your kayaking/competitive experience translate to work?
- What unique perspective do you bring to technical problems?
- How do you combine creativity with technical skills?
- What can you do that other developers might not?

_Answer:_
_(Combine art/teaching/kayaking background with tech skills - unique value proposition)_
I think my art background helped me develop a level of intuition and flexibility that are rare in programmers. I can often tell through gut instinct when a solution is wrong, or when the structure of a project is flawed and will produce bugs later on. This often saves me a lot of time and effort, over the people who don't realise there's a problem until they start seeing the actual errors. I also think my art background helps with the idea of failing forward. Art doesn't come with a plan or a set path. You have a vision and feel your way towards it, failures become creative solutions. Where other people get frustrated by setbacks or mistakes, I see them as part of the process and usually turn them into something valuable.
I think my leadership style makes me unique too. I found during my time teaching that most people generally want the same thing. In the case of kayaking they wanted to be better kayakers. In work context people want to make a good product. In both they want to be valued and heard and supported in their own growth. I don't think people need to be forced or manipulated to do a good job, they just need to be in an environment that lets them do that. Teaching is the same. The developers I've helped train wanted to learn, they had the tools, and the intelligence. They just needed to feel like it was safe to make mistakes and to be able to ask what they thought were silly questions.
I combine creativity with technical skills the same way I did as an artist. Programming languages and technologies are just tools, same as brushes and paints. You have a vision to work towards and everything between you and that goal is just technical challenges and problem solving. I think art may have given me a different, more flexible outlook on it, but I think creation is the same regardless of the discipline.

## Salary & Logistics

### 10. What are your salary expectations?

**Breakdown:**
- How do you handle this question diplomatically?
- Do you research market rates before answering?
- Do you provide a range or specific number?
- How do you negotiate without being too rigid?
- What factors influence your salary expectations? (location, role level, benefits)
- How do you respond if the offer is below expectations?

_Answer:_

I handle salary expectations by first researching market rates for my experience level and the specific role in the Canadian market. I look at factors like location, role responsibilities, company size, and typical compensation for someone with 3.5 years of production experience plus AI/ML skills.

I typically provide a range rather than a specific number, based on my research. I frame it as "I'm looking for something competitive in the range of [X-Y] based on market research for this role and my experience level, but I'm flexible and consider the full opportunity."

I emphasize that I'm looking for a competitive package that reflects the value I bring - my production experience, AI/ML capabilities, and leadership skills. However, I'm also flexible and consider growth opportunities, team culture, benefits, and the work itself as important factors. I'm more interested in finding the right fit than maximizing salary alone.

I consider the full compensation package, not just base salary. Benefits, professional development opportunities, growth potential, and work-life balance all factor into my decision. A role with great growth opportunities might be worth more to me than a higher salary with limited advancement.

If an offer is below my research-based expectations, I acknowledge the offer positively and reference my market research. I ask if there's flexibility on the compensation package, and I'm also open to discussing other aspects that could make it work - additional benefits, professional development support, growth opportunities, or other factors that add value.

The key is being professional, showing I've done my research, demonstrating flexibility, and focusing on finding the right opportunity rather than just the number. I want to ensure the compensation is fair and competitive for my skills and experience, while remaining open to the full value proposition of the role.


### 11. When can you start?

**Breakdown:**
- What's your current notice period at Nurtur?
- How much flexibility do you have with start dates?
- Are there any commitments that affect your start date?
- How quickly can you start if needed?
- What's your ideal timeline for starting a new role?

_Answer:_

My current notice period at Nurtur is 4 weeks. I'm committed to giving proper notice and ensuring a smooth transition, which includes documenting my work thoroughly and helping transition my responsibilities.

After receiving a job offer, I'll need to find housing in Canada, which adds some variability to the exact start date. However, I can handle house hunting during my notice period while completing my transition at Nurtur, so this shouldn't significantly delay my start date. I'm flexible and can work with the employer to find a timeline that works for both parties.

I don't have any other commitments that would affect my start date beyond the notice period and housing arrangements. My focus is on making a smooth transition and starting the new role ready to contribute.

My ideal timeline would be to give proper notice, complete the transition at Nurtur, secure housing in Canada, and then start the new role. However, I'm flexible and understand that different opportunities may have different timelines. I can work remotely from the UK during the transition period if needed, which provides additional flexibility for start dates while I complete my notice period and finalize relocation arrangements.

I'm committed to making this work and will be proactive about finding housing once I have an offer, so I can start as soon as is reasonable after my notice period.


### 12. What's your availability?

**Breakdown:**
- What's your current availability for interviews?
- What's your notice period?
- How flexible are you with start dates?
- Are you available for immediate start if needed?
- Do you have any time commitments that affect availability?

_Answer:_

I can make time for interviews whenever needed. I'm flexible with scheduling and can accommodate different time zones. Fortunately, because of the time difference between the UK and Canada, most of my interviews have been in the evening UK time, which works very well for me and doesn't interfere with my current work schedule.

For notice period, start date flexibility, and other availability details, see question 11 above. My 4-week notice period and housing search timeline are covered there, along with my flexibility to work remotely during the transition period.


### 13. Are you willing to relocate?

**Breakdown:**
- Are you actively planning to relocate to Canada?
- What's your timeline for relocation?
- Are you open to relocating for the right opportunity?
- Do you need visa sponsorship?
- How does relocation fit into your career plans?
- Are you flexible about location within Canada?

_Answer:_

Relocating to Canada is my entire plan - it's not just a possibility, it's the goal. I'm actively pursuing permanent residence in Canada and have an approved Working Holiday Visa, which allows me to work in Canada immediately without requiring employer sponsorship.

I haven't secured housing yet because I want to remain flexible for whatever job offer I receive. As soon as I get an offer, I'll immediately start looking for housing in that specific area. This approach ensures I can choose the right location based on the opportunity, rather than being locked into a location before finding the right role.

I'm flexible about location within Canada. My priority is finding the right opportunity and team, and I'm willing to relocate to wherever that opportunity is. Whether that's Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, or anywhere else in Canada, I'm committed to making the move.

I don't need visa sponsorship. I have an approved Working Holiday Visa that allows me to work in Canada for up to 2 years. After a year of work experience in Canada, I'll apply myself for permanent residence through the appropriate immigration pathway. This self-managed approach means employers don't need to handle any visa paperwork or sponsorship - I can start work immediately upon receiving an offer.

Relocation is central to my career plans. I'm not just exploring options - I'm committed to building my life and career in Canada long-term. This is a deliberate decision based on alignment with Canadian values, culture, and the opportunities available in the Canadian tech sector.

I'm looking for companies where I can work with great teams and continue growing professionally. What matters most to me is finding a collaborative environment where I can make a real impact and contribute to building something excellent.

I thrive in team environments where people work well together, communicate openly, and support each other's growth. I've found I do my best work when I'm part of a motivated team where everyone is committed to quality and we can share ideas, solve problems together, and learn from each other. Whether that's a small tight-knit team or a larger organization with strong team culture, what matters is that collaboration and mutual respect are valued.

I'm particularly interested in roles where I can apply my full-stack and AI/ML skills while continuing to develop, especially in areas like AI integration, systems architecture, and leadership. I value companies that invest in their developers' growth, provide opportunities for mentorship and leadership development, and create environments where technical excellence is valued.

I'm flexible about industry and company size - what matters is the team culture, the quality of the work, and the opportunity to contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow professionally. I'm looking for a place where I can establish myself long-term and build a career with a team I enjoy working with.

## Notes

- Answer as you would in a real interview - professional, honest, but strategic
- Be specific and include examples where relevant
- For diplomatic answers, focus on what you're looking FOR rather than what you're avoiding
- Think about how a non-technical recruiter would understand your answers
