## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Hardware/Unique Projects (17 notes)
1. **Atlantis** (10 notes) - Most unique, hardware focus, pivot story
2. **Cirrus** (7 notes) - Technical depth, cancelled project lessons

**Why first:** These are the most unique projects that demonstrate breadth beyond web development.

### Phase 2: Current Work (14 notes)
3. **Nexus Dashboard** (7 notes) - Current work, architecture focus
4. **Folio** (7 notes) - Current project, RAG expertise

**Why second:** Demonstrates what you're working on RIGHT NOW.

### Phase 3: Production Success Stories (14 notes)
5. **Integrations Dashboard** (7 notes) - Production longevity
6. **Portfolio Website** (7 notes) - Design system thinking

**Why third:** Proven track record of successful projects.

### Phase 4: Team & Learning (8 notes)
7. **Email Editor** (5 notes) - Team collaboration
8. **Jam Hot** (3 notes) - Learning journey

**Why last:** Completes the narrative, shows growth.

### Phase 5: Test & Validate
9. **Embed all new notes** (~84 total)
10. **Run test retrieval** (17 queries across 8 projects)
11. **Analyze multi-project behavior** (precision, separation, cross-project)

## Testing Strategy

### Test Queries for New Projects:
- "Tell me about Atlantis" (expect 5/5 Atlantis notes)
- "Tell me about the lake mapping system" (expect Atlantis notes)
- "What's the Nexus Dashboard?" (expect 5/5 Nexus notes)
- "Tell me about your work at Nurtur" (expect mix of all 3 work projects)
- "What project did you build with LoRa?" (expect Atlantis notes)
- "Tell me about Cirrus" (expect Cirrus notes, not confusion with weather in WhatNow)
- "What's your theatrical portfolio website?" (expect Portfolio Website notes)
- "How did Jam Hot lead to WhatNow?" (expect both Jam Hot and WhatNow notes)
- "Tell me about Folio" (expect Folio notes, not other projects)

### Success Criteria:
- Project-specific queries: 3-5/5 project notes
- Cross-project queries: Appropriate mix from relevant projects
- Work queries: Mix of Nexus, Integrations, Email Editor
- AI journey queries: Mix of Jam Hot, WhatNow, moh-ami, Folio
- Query time: <50ms (still acceptable at 84 notes)
- No confusion between projects with similar domains

## Expected Outcomes

### Scalability Validation:
- 84 notes = 2.7x growth from iteration 2
- Query time projected: 25-35ms (still excellent)
- Storage: ~4MB (manageable)
- Embedding cost: ~$0.08 total (negligible)

### Portfolio Coverage:
- **8 major projects** comprehensively documented
- **AI journey** (Jam Hot → WhatNow → moh-ami → Folio)
- **Hardware expertise** (Atlantis, sensor integration)
- **Work experience** (3 Nurtur projects with different focuses)
- **Design thinking** (Portfolio Website theatrical concept)
- **Technical depth** (Cirrus algorithms despite cancellation)

### Employer Value:
- Demonstrates breadth (web, hardware, AI, design)
- Shows depth (each project 5-10 notes)
- Proves production skills (Integrations 2+ years zero maintenance)
- Illustrates learning (Jam Hot failure → WhatNow success)
- Current work (Nexus, Folio show what you're doing now)

## Time Estimate

- **Writing notes**: ~6-8 hours (53 notes × 8-10 min each)
- **Embedding**: ~5 minutes (automated script)
- **Testing**: ~10 minutes (automated script)
- **Analysis**: ~30 minutes (review results, document findings)
- **Total**: ~7-9 hours for complete portfolio documentation

## Next Step

Start with **Atlantis** (10 notes) as it's the most unique and demonstrates hardware/systems thinking beyond typical web development portfolios.
